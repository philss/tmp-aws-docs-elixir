For more information about importing certificates into ACM, see Importing Certificates in the AWS Certificate Manager User Guide. ACM does not provide managed renewal for certificates that you import. Note the following guidelines when importing third party certificates: You must enter the private key that matches the certificate you are importing. The private key must be unencrypted. You cannot import a private key that is protected by a password or a passphrase. If the certificate you are importing is not self-signed, you must enter its certificate chain. If a certificate chain is included, the issuer must be the subject of one of the certificates in the chain. The certificate, private key, and certificate chain must be PEM-encoded. The current time must be between the Not Before and Not After certificate fields. The Issuer field must not be empty. The OCSP authority URL, if present, must not exceed 1000 characters.

Include this argument only when you want to replace a previously imported certifica When you import a certificate by using the CLI, you must specify the certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key by their file names preceded by file://. For example, you can specify a certificate saved in the C: emp folder as file://C: empcertificate_to_import.pem. If you are making an HTTP or HTTPS Query request, include these arguments as BLOBs. When you import a certificate by using an SDK, you must specify the certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key files in the manner required by the programming language you&#39;re using.

AppConfig supports controlled deployments to applications of any size and includes built-in validation checks and monitoring. You can use AppConfig with applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Lambda, containers, mobile applications, or IoT devices. To prevent errors when deploying application configurations, especially for production systems where a simple typo could cause an unexpected outage, AppConfig includes validators. A validator provides a syntactic or semantic check to ensure that the configuration you want to deploy works as intended. To validate your application configuration data, you provide a schema or a Lambda function that runs against the configuration. The configuration deployment or update can only proceed when the configuration data is valid. During a configuration deployment, AppConfig monitors the application to ensure that the deployment is successful. If the system encounters an error, AppConfig rolls back the change to minimize impact for your application users. You can configure a deployment strategy for each application or environment that includes deployment criteria, including velocity, bake time, and alarms to monitor. Similar to error monitoring, if a deployment triggers an alarm, AppConfig automatically rolls back to the previous version. AppConfig supports multiple use cases. Here are some examples. Application tuning: Use AppConfig to carefully introduce changes to your application that can only be tested with production traffic. Feature toggle: Use AppConfig to turn on new features that require a timely deployment, such as a product launch or announcement. Allow list: Use AppConfig to allow premium subscribers to access paid content. Operational issues: Use AppConfig to reduce stress on your application when a dependency or other external factor impacts the system.

Each scalable target is identified by a service namespace, resource ID, and scalable dimension. A scaling policy applies to the scalable target identified by those three attributes. You cannot create a scaling policy until you have registered the resource as a scalable target. Multiple scaling policies can be in force at the same time for the same scalable target. You can have one or more target tracking scaling policies, one or more step scaling policies, or both. However, there is a chance that multiple policies could conflict, instructing the scalable target to scale out or in at the same time. Application Auto Scaling gives precedence to the policy that provides the largest capacity for both scale out and scale in. For example, if one policy increases capacity by 3, another policy increases capacity by 200 percent, and the current capacity is 10, Application Auto Scaling uses the policy with the highest calculated capacity (200% of 10 = 20) and scales out to 30. We recommend caution, however, when using target tracking scaling policies with step scaling policies because conflicts between these policies can cause undesirable behavior. For example, if the step scaling policy initiates a scale-in activity before the target tracking policy is ready to scale in, the scale-in activity will not be blocked. After the scale-in activity completes, the target tracking policy could instruct the scalable target to scale out again.

It automatically identifies servers, virtual machines (VMs), and network dependencies in your on-premises data centers. For more information, see the AWS Application Discovery Service FAQ. Application Discovery Service offers three ways of performing discovery and collecting data about your on-premises servers: Agentless discovery is recommended for environments that use VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn&#39;t require you to install an agent on each host. It does not work in non-VMware environments. Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the operating systems, which minimizes the time required for initial on-premises infrastructure assessment. Agentless discovery doesn&#39;t collect information about network dependencies, only agent-based discovery collects that information. Agent-based discovery collects a richer set of data than agentless discovery by using the AWS Application Discovery Agent, which you install on one or more hosts in your data center. The agent captures infrastructure and application information, including an inventory of running processes, system performance information, resource utilization, and network dependencies. The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in transit to the Application Discovery Service database in the cloud. AWS Partner Network (APN) solutions integrate with Application Discovery Service, enabling you to import details of your on-premises environment directly into Migration Hub without using the discovery connector or discovery agent. Third-party application discovery tools can query AWS Application Discovery Service, and they can write to the Application Discovery Service database using the public API. In this way, you can import data into Migration Hub and view it, so that you can associate applications with servers and track migrations. Recommendations We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments, and whenever you want to collect information about network dependencies. You can run agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless discovery to complete the initial infrastructure assessment quickly, and then install agents on select hosts to collect additional information. Working With This Guide This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for Application Discovery Service. The topic for each action shows the API request parameters and the response. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming language or platform that you&#39;re using. For more information, see AWS SDKs. Remember that you must set your Migration Hub home region before you call any of these APIs. You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify, associate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your home region, or a HomeRegionNotSetException error is returned. API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are permitted outside of your home region. Although it is unlikely, the Migration Hub home region could change. If you call APIs outside the home region, an InvalidInputException is returned. You must call GetHomeRegion to obtain the latest Migration Hub home region. This guide is intended for use with the AWS Application Discovery Service User Guide. All data is handled according to the AWS Privacy Policy. You can operate Application Discovery Service offline to inspect collected data before it is shared with the service."},{"ref":"AWS.ApplicationDiscovery.html#associate_configuration_items_to_application/3","title":"AWS.ApplicationDiscovery.associate_configuration_items_to_application/3","type":"function","doc":"Associates one or more configuration items with an application."},{"ref":"AWS.ApplicationDiscovery.html#batch_delete_import_data/3","title":"AWS.ApplicationDiscovery.batch_delete_import_data/3","type":"function","doc":"Deletes one or more import tasks, each identified by their import ID.

For example, if the group currently has 100% On-Demand capacity and the policy specifies 50% Spot capacity, this means that half of your instances will be gradually terminated and relaunched as Spot Instances. When replacing instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches new instances before terminating the old ones, so that updating your group does not compromise the performance or availability of your application. Note the following about changing DesiredCapacity, MaxSize, or MinSize: If a scale-in activity occurs as a result of a new DesiredCapacity value that is lower than the current size of the group, the Auto Scaling group uses its termination policy to determine which instances to terminate. If you specify a new value for MinSize without specifying a value for DesiredCapacity, and the new MinSize is larger than the current size of the group, this sets the group&#39;s DesiredCapacity to the new MinSize value. If you specify a new value for MaxSize without specifying a value for DesiredCapacity, and the new MaxSize is smaller than the current size of the group, this sets the group&#39;s DesiredCapacity to the new MaxSize value. To see which parameters have been set, call the DescribeAutoScalingGroups API. To view the scaling policies for an Auto Scaling group, call the DescribePolicies API. If the group has scaling policies, you can update them by calling the PutScalingPolicy API."},{"ref":"AWS.AutoScalingPlans.html","title":"AWS.AutoScalingPlans","type":"module","doc":"AWS Auto Scaling Use AWS Auto Scaling to quickly discover all the scalable AWS resources for your application and configure dynamic scaling and predictive scaling for your resources using scaling plans.

This guide provides detailed information about the Amazon Chime API, including operations, types, inputs and outputs, and error codes. It also includes some server-side API actions to use with the Amazon Chime SDK. For more information about the Amazon Chime SDK, see Using the Amazon Chime SDK in the Amazon Chime Developer Guide. You can use an AWS SDK, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the REST API to make API calls. We recommend using an AWS SDK or the AWS CLI. Each API operation includes links to information about using it with a language-specific AWS SDK or the AWS CLI. Definitions Using an AWS SDK You don&#39;t need to write code to calculate a signature for request authentication. The SDK clients authenticate your requests by using access keys that you provide. For more information about AWS SDKs, see the AWS Developer Center. Using the AWS CLI Use your access keys with the AWS CLI to make API calls. For information about setting up the AWS CLI, see Installing the AWS Command Line Interface in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide. For a list of available Amazon Chime commands, see the Amazon Chime commands in the AWS CLI Command Reference. Using REST API If you use REST to make API calls, you must authenticate your request by providing a signature. Amazon Chime supports signature version 4. For more information, see Signature Version 4 Signing Process in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. When making REST API calls, use the service name chime and REST endpoint https://service.chime.aws.amazon.com. Administrative permissions are controlled using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). For more information, see Identity and Access Management for Amazon Chime in the Amazon Chime Administration Guide."},{"ref":"AWS.Chime.html#associate_phone_number_with_user/5","title":"AWS.Chime.associate_phone_number_with_user/5","type":"function","doc":"Associates a phone number with the specified Amazon Chime user."},{"ref":"AWS.Chime.html#associate_phone_numbers_with_voice_connector/4","title":"AWS.Chime.associate_phone_numbers_with_voice_connector/4","type":"function","doc":"Associates phone numbers with the specified Amazon Chime Voice Connector."},{"ref":"AWS.Chime.html#associate_phone_numbers_with_voice_connector_group/4","title":"AWS.Chime.associate_phone_numbers_with_voice_connector_group/4","type":"function","doc":"Associates phone numbers with the specified Amazon Chime Voice Connector group."},{"ref":"AWS.Chime.html#associate_signin_delegate_groups_with_account/4","title":"AWS.Chime.associate_signin_delegate_groups_with_account/4","type":"function","doc":"Associates the specified sign-in delegate groups with the specified Amazon Chime account."},{"ref":"AWS.Chime.html#batch_create_attendee/4","title":"AWS.Chime.batch_create_attendee/4","type":"function","doc":"Creates up to 100 new attendees for an active Amazon Chime SDK meeting.

You can create multiple metric alarms, and also create a composite alarm and set up alerts only for the composite alarm. For example, you could create a composite alarm that goes into ALARM state only when more than one of the underlying metric alarms are in ALARM state. Currently, the only alarm actions that can be taken by composite alarms are notifying SNS topics. It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B also depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can&#39;t delete any composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there is always still a composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to delete. To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency that creates the cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is to change the AlarmRule of one of the alarms to False.

Rules with ScheduleExpressions self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule can have both an EventPattern and a ScheduleExpression, in which case the rule triggers on matching events as well as on a schedule. When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one or more tags to the rule. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only rules with certain tag values. To use the PutRule operation and assign tags, you must have both the events:PutRule and events:TagResource permissions. If you are updating an existing rule, any tags you specify in the PutRule operation are ignored. To update the tags of an existing rule, use TagResource and UntagResource. Most services in AWS treat : or / as the same character in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). However, EventBridge uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to match. In EventBridge, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to change them to the desired state. If the rule is not written carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an infinite loop. To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not re-fire the same rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change. An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges.

You can configure the following as targets for Events: EC2 instances SSM Run Command SSM Automation AWS Lambda functions Data streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Data delivery streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Amazon ECS tasks AWS Step Functions state machines AWS Batch jobs AWS CodeBuild projects Pipelines in AWS CodePipeline Amazon Inspector assessment templates Amazon SNS topics Amazon SQS queues, including FIFO queues The default event bus of another AWS account Amazon API Gateway REST APIs Redshift Clusters to invoke Data API ExecuteStatement on Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the AWS Management Console. The built-in targets are EC2 CreateSnapshot API call, EC2 RebootInstances API call, EC2 StopInstances API call, and EC2 TerminateInstances API call. For some target types, PutTargets provides target-specific parameters. If the target is a Kinesis data stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the KinesisParameters argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the RunCommandParameters field. To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) needs the appropriate permissions. For AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, EventBridge relies on resource-based policies. For EC2 instances, Kinesis data streams, AWS Step Functions state machines and API Gateway REST APIs, EventBridge relies on IAM roles that you specify in the RoleARN argument in PutTargets. For more information, see Authentication and Access Control in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide. If another AWS account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using PutPermission), you can send events to that account. Set that account&#39;s event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To send the matched events to the other account, specify that account&#39;s event bus as the Arn value when you run PutTargets. If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event is not charged. For more information, see Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) Pricing. Input, InputPath, and InputTransformer are not available with PutTarget if the target is an event bus of a different AWS account. If you are setting the event bus of another account as the target, and that account granted permission to your account through an organization instead of directly by the account ID, then you must specify a RoleArn with proper permissions in the Target structure. For more information, see Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS Accounts in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide. For more information about enabling cross-account events, see PutPermission. Input, InputPath, and InputTransformer are mutually exclusive and optional parameters of a target. When a rule is triggered due to a matched event: If none of the following arguments are specified for a target, then the entire event is passed to the target in JSON format (unless the target is Amazon EC2 Run Command or Amazon ECS task, in which case nothing from the event is passed to the target). If Input is specified in the form of valid JSON, then the matched event is overridden with this constant. If InputPath is specified in the form of JSONPath (for example, $.detail), then only the part of the event specified in the path is passed to the target (for example, only the detail part of the event is passed). If InputTransformer is specified, then one or more specified JSONPaths are extracted from the event and used as values in a template that you specify as the input to the target. When you specify InputPath or InputTransformer, you must use JSON dot notation, not bracket notation. When you add targets to a rule and the associated rule triggers soon after, new or updated targets might not be immediately invoked. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.

For example, CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your application logs and send you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold that you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for monitoring so no code changes are required. For example, you can monitor application logs for specific literal terms (such as &quot;NullReferenceException&quot;) or count the number of occurrences of a literal term at a particular position in log data (such as &quot;404&quot; status codes in an Apache access log). When the term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch metric that you specify.

To get the document endpoint for your domain, use the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service DescribeDomains action. A domain&#39;s endpoints are also displayed on the domain dashboard in the Amazon CloudSearch console.

AWS CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. AWS CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for the most popular programming languages and build tools, such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments in AWS CodeBuild to use your own build tools. AWS CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build requests. You pay only for the build time you consume. For more information about AWS CodeBuild, see the AWS CodeBuild User Guide. AWS CodeBuild supports these operations: BatchDeleteBuilds: Deletes one or more builds. BatchGetBuilds: Gets information about one or more builds. BatchGetProjects: Gets information about one or more build projects. A build project defines how AWS CodeBuild runs a build. This includes information such as where to get the source code to build, the build environment to use, the build commands to run, and where to store the build output. A build environment is a representation of operating system, programming language runtime, and tools that AWS CodeBuild uses to run a build. You can add tags to build projects to help manage your resources and costs. BatchGetReportGroups: Returns an array of report groups. BatchGetReports: Returns an array of reports. CreateProject: Creates a build project. CreateReportGroup: Creates a report group. A report group contains a collection of reports. CreateWebhook: For an existing AWS CodeBuild build project that has its source code stored in a GitHub or Bitbucket repository, enables AWS CodeBuild to start rebuilding the source code every time a code change is pushed to the repository. DeleteProject: Deletes a build project. DeleteReport: Deletes a report. DeleteReportGroup: Deletes a report group. DeleteResourcePolicy: Deletes a resource policy that is identified by its resource ARN. DeleteSourceCredentials: Deletes a set of GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket source credentials. DeleteWebhook: For an existing AWS CodeBuild build project that has its source code stored in a GitHub or Bitbucket repository, stops AWS CodeBuild from rebuilding the source code every time a code change is pushed to the repository. DescribeTestCases: Returns a list of details about test cases for a report. GetResourcePolicy: Gets a resource policy that is identified by its resource ARN. ImportSourceCredentials: Imports the source repository credentials for an AWS CodeBuild project that has its source code stored in a GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket repository.

You can deploy a nearly unlimited variety of application content, such as an updated Lambda function, updated applications in an Amazon ECS service, code, web and configuration files, executables, packages, scripts, multimedia files, and so on. AWS CodeDeploy can deploy application content stored in Amazon S3 buckets, GitHub repositories, or Bitbucket repositories. You do not need to make changes to your existing code before you can use AWS CodeDeploy. AWS CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid downtime during application deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications, without many of the risks associated with error-prone manual deployments. AWS CodeDeploy Components Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following AWS CodeDeploy components: Application: A name that uniquely identifies the application you want to deploy. AWS CodeDeploy uses this name, which functions as a container, to ensure the correct combination of revision, deployment configuration, and deployment group are referenced during a deployment. Deployment group: A set of individual instances, CodeDeploy Lambda deployment configuration settings, or an Amazon ECS service and network details. A Lambda deployment group specifies how to route traffic to a new version of a Lambda function. An Amazon ECS deployment group specifies the service created in Amazon ECS to deploy, a load balancer, and a listener to reroute production traffic to an updated containerized application. An EC2/On-premises deployment group contains individually tagged instances, Amazon EC2 instances in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or both. All deployment groups can specify optional trigger, alarm, and rollback settings. Deployment configuration: A set of deployment rules and deployment success and failure conditions used by AWS CodeDeploy during a deployment. Deployment: The process and the components used when updating a Lambda function, a containerized application in an Amazon ECS service, or of installing content on one or more instances. Application revisions: For an AWS Lambda deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the Lambda function to be updated and one or more functions to validate deployment lifecycle events. For an Amazon ECS deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the Amazon ECS task definition, container, and port where production traffic is rerouted. For an EC2/On-premises deployment, this is an archive file that contains source content—source code, webpages, executable files, and deployment scripts—along with an AppSpec file. Revisions are stored in Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub repositories. For Amazon S3, a revision is uniquely identified by its Amazon S3 object key and its ETag, version, or both. For GitHub, a revision is uniquely identified by its commit ID. This guide also contains information to help you get details about the instances in your deployments, to make on-premises instances available for AWS CodeDeploy deployments, to get details about a Lambda function deployment, and to get details about Amazon ECS service deployments.

The aggregated profile&#39;s aggregation period determines how long it is retained by CodeGuru Profiler. * If the aggregation period is 5 minutes, the aggregated profile is retained for 15 days. * If the aggregation period is 1 hour, the aggregated profile is retained for 60 days. * If the aggregation period is 1 day, the aggregated profile is retained for 3 years. There are two use cases for callingGetProfile. 1. If you want to return an aggregated profile that already exists, use [ListProfileTimes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/profiler-api/API_ListProfileTimes.html) to view the time ranges of existing aggregated profiles. Use them in aGetProfilerequest to return a specific, existing aggregated profile. 2. If you want to return an aggregated profile for a time range that doesn&#39;t align with an existing aggregated profile, then CodeGuru Profiler makes a best effort to combine existing aggregated profiles from the requested time range and return them as one aggregated profile. If aggregated profiles do not exist for the full time range requested, then aggregated profiles for a smaller time range are returned. For example, if the requested time range is from 00:00 to 00:20, and the existing aggregated profiles are from 00:15 and 00:25, then the aggregated profiles from 00:15 to 00:20 are returned."},{"ref":"AWS.CodeGuruProfiler.html#get_recommendations/6","title":"AWS.CodeGuruProfiler.get_recommendations/6","type":"function","doc":"Returns a list of Recommendation objects that contain recommendations for a profiling group for a given time period.

This guide provides descriptions of the actions and data types for AWS CodePipeline. Some functionality for your pipeline can only be configured through the API. For more information, see the AWS CodePipeline User Guide. You can use the AWS CodePipeline API to work with pipelines, stages, actions, and transitions. Pipelines are models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is uniquely named, and consists of stages, actions, and transitions. You can work with pipelines by calling: CreatePipeline, which creates a uniquely named pipeline. DeletePipeline, which deletes the specified pipeline. GetPipeline, which returns information about the pipeline structure and pipeline metadata, including the pipeline Amazon Resource Name (ARN). GetPipelineExecution, which returns information about a specific execution of a pipeline. GetPipelineState, which returns information about the current state of the stages and actions of a pipeline. ListActionExecutions, which returns action-level details for past executions. The details include full stage and action-level details, including individual action duration, status, any errors that occurred during the execution, and input and output artifact location details. ListPipelines, which gets a summary of all of the pipelines associated with your account. ListPipelineExecutions, which gets a summary of the most recent executions for a pipeline. StartPipelineExecution, which runs the most recent revision of an artifact through the pipeline. StopPipelineExecution, which stops the specified pipeline execution from continuing through the pipeline. UpdatePipeline, which updates a pipeline with edits or changes to the structure of the pipeline. Pipelines include stages. Each stage contains one or more actions that must complete before the next stage begins. A stage results in success or failure. If a stage fails, the pipeline stops at that stage and remains stopped until either a new version of an artifact appears in the source location, or a user takes action to rerun the most recent artifact through the pipeline. You can call GetPipelineState, which displays the status of a pipeline, including the status of stages in the pipeline, or GetPipeline, which returns the entire structure of the pipeline, including the stages of that pipeline. For more information about the structure of stages and actions, see AWS CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference. Pipeline stages include actions that are categorized into categories such as source or build actions performed in a stage of a pipeline. For example, you can use a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline from a source such as Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions directly in most cases, but you do define and interact with actions when working with pipeline operations such as CreatePipeline and GetPipelineState. Valid action categories are: Source Build Test Deploy Approval Invoke Pipelines also include transitions, which allow the transition of artifacts from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the actions in one stage complete. You can work with transitions by calling: DisableStageTransition, which prevents artifacts from transitioning to the next stage in a pipeline. EnableStageTransition, which enables transition of artifacts between stages in a pipeline. Using the API to integrate with AWS CodePipeline For third-party integrators or developers who want to create their own integrations with AWS CodePipeline, the expected sequence varies from the standard API user. To integrate with AWS CodePipeline, developers need to work with the following items: Jobs, which are instances of an action. For example, a job for a source action might import a revision of an artifact from a source. You can work with jobs by calling: AcknowledgeJob, which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job. GetJobDetails, which returns the details of a job. PollForJobs, which determines whether there are any jobs to act on. PutJobFailureResult, which provides details of a job failure. PutJobSuccessResult, which provides details of a job success. Third party jobs, which are instances of an action created by a partner action and integrated into AWS CodePipeline. Partner actions are created by members of the AWS Partner Network. You can work with third party jobs by calling: AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob, which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job. GetThirdPartyJobDetails, which requests the details of a job for a partner action. PollForThirdPartyJobs, which determines whether there are any jobs to act on. PutThirdPartyJobFailureResult, which provides details of a job failure. PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult, which provides details of a job success."},{"ref":"AWS.CodePipeline.html#acknowledge_job/3","title":"AWS.CodePipeline.acknowledge_job/3","type":"function","doc":"Returns information about a specified job and whether that job has been received by the job worker.

Each connection is named and associated with a unique ARN that is used to reference the connection. When you create a connection, the console initiates a third-party connection handshake. Installations are the apps that are used to conduct this handshake. For example, the installation for the Bitbucket provider type is the Bitbucket Cloud app. When you create a connection, you can choose an existing installation or create one. When you want to create a connection to an installed provider type such as GitHub Enterprise Server, you create a host for your connections. You can work with connections by calling: CreateConnection, which creates a uniquely named connection that can be referenced by services such as CodePipeline. DeleteConnection, which deletes the specified connection. GetConnection, which returns information about the connection, including the connection status. ListConnections, which lists the connections associated with your account. You can work with hosts by calling: CreateHost, which creates a host that represents the infrastructure where your provider is installed. DeleteHost, which deletes the specified host. GetHost, which returns information about the host, including the setup status. ListHosts, which lists the hosts associated with your account. You can work with tags in AWS CodeStar Connections by calling the following: ListTagsForResource, which gets information about AWS tags for a specified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in AWS CodeStar Connections. TagResource, which adds or updates tags for a resource in AWS CodeStar Connections. UntagResource, which removes tags for a resource in AWS CodeStar Connections.

You can use CodeArtifact to share packages with development teams and pull packages. Packages can be pulled from both public and CodeArtifact repositories. You can also create an upstream relationship between a CodeArtifact repository and another repository, which effectively merges their contents from the point of view of a package manager client. AWS CodeArtifact Components Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following CodeArtifact components: Repository: A CodeArtifact repository contains a set of package versions, each of which maps to a set of assets, or files. Repositories are polyglot, so a single repository can contain packages of any supported type. Each repository exposes endpoints for fetching and publishing packages using tools like the npm CLI, the Maven CLI ( mvn ), and pip . You can create up to 100 repositories per AWS account. Domain: Repositories are aggregated into a higher-level entity known as a domain. All package assets and metadata are stored in the domain, but are consumed through repositories. A given package asset, such as a Maven JAR file, is stored once per domain, no matter how many repositories it&#39;s present in. All of the assets and metadata in a domain are encrypted with the same customer master key (CMK) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Each repository is a member of a single domain and can&#39;t be moved to a different domain. The domain allows organizational policy to be applied across multiple repositories, such as which accounts can access repositories in the domain, and which public repositories can be used as sources of packages. Although an organization can have multiple domains, we recommend a single production domain that contains all published artifacts so that teams can find and share packages across their organization. Package: A package is a bundle of software and the metadata required to resolve dependencies and install the software. CodeArtifact supports npm, PyPI, and Maven package formats. In CodeArtifact, a package consists of: A name (for example, webpack is the name of a popular npm package) An optional namespace (for example, @types in @types/node) A set of versions (for example, 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, etc.) Package-level metadata (for example, npm tags) Package version: A version of a package, such as @types/node 12.6.9. The version number format and semantics vary for different package formats. For example, npm package versions must conform to the Semantic Versioning specification. In CodeArtifact, a package version consists of the version identifier, metadata at the package version level, and a set of assets. Upstream repository: One repository is upstream of another when the package versions in it can be accessed from the repository endpoint of the downstream repository, effectively merging the contents of the two repositories from the point of view of a client. CodeArtifact allows creating an upstream relationship between two repositories. Asset: An individual file stored in CodeArtifact associated with a package version, such as an npm .tgz file or Maven POM and JAR files. CodeArtifact supports these operations: AssociateExternalConnection: Adds an existing external connection to a repository. CopyPackageVersions: Copies package versions from one repository to another repository in the same domain. CreateDomain: Creates a domain CreateRepository: Creates a CodeArtifact repository in a domain. DeleteDomain: Deletes a domain. You cannot delete a domain that contains repositories. DeleteDomainPermissionsPolicy: Deletes the resource policy that is set on a domain. DeletePackageVersions: Deletes versions of a package. After a package has been deleted, it can be republished, but its assets and metadata cannot be restored because they have been permanently removed from storage. DeleteRepository: Deletes a repository. DeleteRepositoryPermissionsPolicy: Deletes the resource policy that is set on a repository. DescribeDomain: Returns a DomainDescription object that contains information about the requested domain. DescribePackageVersion: Returns a [PackageVersionDescription](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/APIReference/API_PackageVersionDescription.html) object that contains details about a package version. DescribeRepository: Returns a RepositoryDescription object that contains detailed information about the requested repository. DisposePackageVersions: Disposes versions of a package. A package version with the status Disposed cannot be restored because they have been permanently removed from storage. DisassociateExternalConnection: Removes an existing external connection from a repository. GetAuthorizationToken: Generates a temporary authorization token for accessing repositories in the domain. The token expires the authorization period has passed. The default authorization period is 12 hours and can be customized to any length with a maximum of 12 hours. GetDomainPermissionsPolicy: Returns the policy of a resource that is attached to the specified domain. GetPackageVersionAsset: Returns the contents of an asset that is in a package version. GetPackageVersionReadme: Gets the readme file or descriptive text for a package version. GetRepositoryEndpoint: Returns the endpoint of a repository for a specific package format. A repository has one endpoint for each package format: npm pypi maven GetRepositoryPermissionsPolicy: Returns the resource policy that is set on a repository. ListDomains: Returns a list of DomainSummary objects. Each returned DomainSummary object contains information about a domain. ListPackages: Lists the packages in a repository. ListPackageVersionAssets: Lists the assets for a given package version. ListPackageVersionDependencies: Returns a list of the direct dependencies for a package version. ListPackageVersions: Returns a list of package versions for a specified package in a repository. ListRepositories: Returns a list of repositories owned by the AWS account that called this method.

A custom domain is used to host the Amazon Cognito hosted UI, which provides sign-up and sign-in pages for your application. When you set up a custom domain, you provide a certificate that you manage with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). When necessary, you can use this operation to change the certificate that you applied to your custom domain. Usually, this is unnecessary following routine certificate renewal with ACM. When you renew your existing certificate in ACM, the ARN for your certificate remains the same, and your custom domain uses the new certificate automatically. However, if you replace your existing certificate with a new one, ACM gives the new certificate a new ARN. To apply the new certificate to your custom domain, you must provide this ARN to Amazon Cognito. When you add your new certificate in ACM, you must choose US East (N. Virginia) as the AWS Region. After you submit your request, Amazon Cognito requires up to 1 hour to distribute your new certificate to your custom domain.

You can also update attributes for a contact using data from your CRM application and save the data with the contact in Amazon Connect. You could also flag calls for additional analysis, such as legal review or identifying abusive callers. Contact attributes are available in Amazon Connect for 24 months, and are then deleted. This operation is also available in the Amazon Connect Flow language. See UpdateContactAttributes. Important: You cannot use the operation to update attributes for contacts that occurred prior to the release of the API, September 12, 2018. You can update attributes only for contacts that started after the release of the API. If you attempt to update attributes for a contact that occurred prior to the release of the API, a 400 error is returned.

If you request more than 100 items, BatchGetItem returns a ValidationException with the message &quot;Too many items requested for the BatchGetItem call.&quot; For example, if you ask to retrieve 100 items, but each individual item is 300 KB in size, the system returns 52 items (so as not to exceed the 16 MB limit). It also returns an appropriate UnprocessedKeys value so you can get the next page of results. If desired, your application can include its own logic to assemble the pages of results into one dataset. If none of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then BatchGetItem returns a ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. If at least one of the items is successfully processed, then BatchGetItem completes successfully, while returning the keys of the unread items in UnprocessedKeys. If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed. For more information, see Batch Operations and Error Handling in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. By default, BatchGetItem performs eventually consistent reads on every table in the request. If you want strongly consistent reads instead, you can set ConsistentRead to true for any or all tables. In order to minimize response latency, BatchGetItem retrieves items in parallel. When designing your application, keep in mind that DynamoDB does not return items in any particular order. To help parse the response by item, include the primary key values for the items in your request in the ProjectionExpression parameter. If a requested item does not exist, it is not returned in the result. Requests for nonexistent items consume the minimum read capacity units according to the type of read. For more information, see Working with Tables in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide."},{"ref":"AWS.DynamoDB.html#batch_write_item/3","title":"AWS.DynamoDB.batch_write_item/3","type":"function","doc":"The BatchWriteItem operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or more tables. A single call to BatchWriteItem can write up to 16 MB of data, which can comprise as many as 25 put or delete requests. Individual items to be written can be as large as 400 KB. BatchWriteItem cannot update items. To update items, use the UpdateItem action. The individual PutItem and DeleteItem operations specified in BatchWriteItem are atomic; however BatchWriteItem as a whole is not. If any requested operations fail because the table&#39;s provisioned throughput is exceeded or an internal processing failure occurs, the failed operations are returned in the UnprocessedItems response parameter. You can investigate and optionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call BatchWriteItem in a loop. Each iteration would check for unprocessed items and submit a new BatchWriteItem request with those unprocessed items until all items have been processed. If none of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then BatchWriteItem returns a ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed. For more information, see Batch Operations and Error Handling in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. With BatchWriteItem, you can efficiently write or delete large amounts of data, such as from Amazon EMR, or copy data from another database into DynamoDB. In order to improve performance with these large-scale operations, BatchWriteItem does not behave in the same way as individual PutItem and DeleteItem calls would. For example, you cannot specify conditions on individual put and delete requests, and BatchWriteItem does not return deleted items in the response. If you use a programming language that supports concurrency, you can use threads to write items in parallel. Your application must include the necessary logic to manage the threads. With languages that don&#39;t support threading, you must update or delete the specified items one at a time. In both situations, BatchWriteItem performs the specified put and delete operations in parallel, giving you the power of the thread pool approach without having to introduce complexity into your application. Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and delete request consumes the same number of write capacity units whether it is processed in parallel or not. Delete operations on nonexistent items consume one write capacity unit. If one or more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire batch write operation: One or more tables specified in the BatchWriteItem request does not exist. Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request do not match those in the corresponding table&#39;s primary key schema. You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in the same BatchWriteItem request. For example, you cannot put and delete the same item in the same BatchWriteItem request. Your request contains at least two items with identical hash and range keys (which essentially is two put operations). There are more than 25 requests in the batch.

Although you can increase these quotas by filing a case at AWS Support Center, obtaining the increase is not instantaneous. The DescribeLimits action lets you write code to compare the capacity you are currently using to those quotas imposed by your account so that you have enough time to apply for an increase before you hit a quota. For example, you could use one of the AWS SDKs to do the following: Call DescribeLimits for a particular Region to obtain your current account quotas on provisioned capacity there. Create a variable to hold the aggregate read capacity units provisioned for all your tables in that Region, and one to hold the aggregate write capacity units. Zero them both. Call ListTables to obtain a list of all your DynamoDB tables. For each table name listed by ListTables, do the following: Call DescribeTable with the table name.

If the number of tasks running in a service drops below the desiredCount, Amazon ECS runs another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see the UpdateService action. In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind one or more load balancers. The load balancers distribute traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see Service Load Balancing in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they&#39;re in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that do use a load balancer are considered healthy if they&#39;re in the RUNNING state and the container instance that they&#39;re hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer. There are two service scheduler strategies available: REPLICA - The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information, see Service Scheduler Concepts in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. DAEMON - The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that do not meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy, you don&#39;t need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see Service Scheduler Concepts in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. The deployment is triggered by changing properties, such as the task definition or the desired count of a service, with an UpdateService operation. The default value for a replica service for minimumHealthyPercent is 100%. The default value for a daemon service for minimumHealthyPercent is 0%. If a service is using the ECS deployment controller, the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the RUNNING state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler might stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they&#39;re in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that do use a load balancer are considered healthy if they&#39;re in the RUNNING state and they&#39;re reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%. If a service is using the ECS deployment controller, the maximum percent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the RUNNING or PENDING state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%. If a service is using either the CODE_DEPLOY or EXTERNAL deployment controller types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values are used only to define the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the RUNNING state while the container instances are in the DRAINING state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values aren&#39;t used, although they&#39;re currently visible when describing your service. When creating a service that uses the EXTERNAL deployment controller, you can specify only parameters that aren&#39;t controlled at the task set level. The only required parameter is the service name. You control your services using the CreateTaskSet operation. For more information, see Amazon ECS Deployment Types in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster using the following logic: Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service&#39;s task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes). By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy) with the placementStrategy parameter): Sort the valid container instances, giving priority to instances that have the fewest number of running tasks for this service in their respective Availability Zone. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement. Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service."},{"ref":"AWS.ECS.html#create_task_set/3","title":"AWS.ECS.create_task_set/3","type":"function","doc":"Create a task set in the specified cluster and service.

Once a container instance has reached an ACTIVE state, you can change the status of a container instance to DRAINING to manually remove an instance from a cluster, for example to perform system updates, update the Docker daemon, or scale down the cluster size. A container instance cannot be changed to DRAINING until it has reached an ACTIVE status. If the instance is in any other status, an error will be received. When you set a container instance to DRAINING, Amazon ECS prevents new tasks from being scheduled for placement on the container instance and replacement service tasks are started on other container instances in the cluster if the resources are available. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the PENDING state are stopped immediately. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the RUNNING state are stopped and replaced according to the service&#39;s deployment configuration parameters, minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent. You can change the deployment configuration of your service using UpdateService. If minimumHealthyPercent is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore desiredCount temporarily during task replacement. For example, desiredCount is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. If the minimum is 100%, the service scheduler can&#39;t remove existing tasks until the replacement tasks are considered healthy. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer. The maximumPercent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during task replacement, which enables you to define the replacement batch size. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four tasks to be drained, provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available. If the maximum is 100%, then replacement tasks can&#39;t start until the draining tasks have stopped. Any PENDING or RUNNING tasks that do not belong to a service are not affected. You must wait for them to finish or stop them manually. A container instance has completed draining when it has no more RUNNING tasks. You can verify this using ListTasks. When a container instance has been drained, you can set a container instance to ACTIVE status and once it has reached that status the Amazon ECS scheduler can begin scheduling tasks on the instance again."},{"ref":"AWS.ECS.html#update_service/3","title":"AWS.ECS.update_service/3","type":"function","doc":"Updating the task placement strategies and constraints on an Amazon ECS service remains in preview and is a Beta Service as defined by and subject to the Beta Service Participation Service Terms located at https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms (&quot;Beta Terms&quot;). These Beta Terms apply to your participation in this preview. Modifies the parameters of a service. For services using the rolling update (ECS) deployment controller, the desired count, deployment configuration, network configuration, task placement constraints and strategies, or task definition used can be updated. For services using the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY) deployment controller, only the desired count, deployment configuration, task placement constraints and strategies, and health check grace period can be updated using this API. If the network configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated, a new AWS CodeDeploy deployment should be created. For more information, see CreateDeployment in the AWS CodeDeploy API Reference. For services using an external deployment controller, you can update only the desired count, task placement constraints and strategies, and health check grace period using this API. If the launch type, load balancer, network configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated, you should create a new task set. For more information, see CreateTaskSet. You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task definition in a service by specifying the cluster that the service is running in and a new desiredCount parameter. If you have updated the Docker image of your application, you can create a new task definition with that image and deploy it to your service. The service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent parameters (in the service&#39;s deployment configuration) to determine the deployment strategy. If your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the existing task definition for your service (for example, my_image:latest), you do not need to create a new revision of your task definition. You can update the service using the forceNewDeployment option. The new tasks launched by the deployment pull the current image/tag combination from your repository when they start. You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service, the service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters, minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent, to determine the deployment strategy. If minimumHealthyPercent is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore desiredCount temporarily during a deployment. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer. The maximumPercent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). When UpdateService stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of docker stop is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a SIGTERM and a 30-second timeout, after which SIGKILL is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the SIGTERM gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no SIGKILL is sent. When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster with the following logic: Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service&#39;s task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes). By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy): Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement. Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service. When the service scheduler stops running tasks, it attempts to maintain balance across the Availability Zones in your cluster using the following logic: Sort the container instances by the largest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have two, container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for termination.

The operation requires a creation token in the request that Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent creation (calling the operation with same creation token has no effect). If a file system does not currently exist that is owned by the caller&#39;s AWS account with the specified creation token, this operation does the following: Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an Amazon EFS assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state creating. Returns with the description of the created file system. Otherwise, this operation returns a FileSystemAlreadyExists error with the ID of the existing file system. For basic use cases, you can use a randomly generated UUID for the creation token. The idempotent operation allows you to retry a CreateFileSystem call without risk of creating an extra file system. This can happen when an initial call fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a file system was actually created. An example might be that a transport level timeout occurred or your connection was reset. As long as you use the same creation token, if the initial call had succeeded in creating a file system, the client can learn of its existence from the FileSystemAlreadyExists error. The CreateFileSystem call returns while the file system&#39;s lifecycle state is still creating. You can check the file system creation status by calling the DescribeFileSystems operation, which among other things returns the file system state. This operation also takes an optional PerformanceMode parameter that you choose for your file system. We recommend generalPurpose performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the maxIO performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file operations. The performance mode can&#39;t be changed after the file system has been created. For more information, see Amazon EFS: Performance Modes.

You can then mount the file system on EC2 instances by using the mount target. You can create one mount target in each Availability Zone in your VPC. All EC2 instances in a VPC within a given Availability Zone share a single mount target for a given file system. If you have multiple subnets in an Availability Zone, you create a mount target in one of the subnets. EC2 instances do not need to be in the same subnet as the mount target in order to access their file system. For more information, see Amazon EFS: How it Works. In the request, you also specify a file system ID for which you are creating the mount target and the file system&#39;s lifecycle state must be available. For more information, see DescribeFileSystems. In the request, you also provide a subnet ID, which determines the following: VPC in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target Availability Zone in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target IP address range from which Amazon EFS selects the IP address of the mount target (if you don&#39;t specify an IP address in the request) After creating the mount target, Amazon EFS returns a response that includes, a MountTargetId and an IpAddress. You use this IP address when mounting the file system in an EC2 instance. You can also use the mount target&#39;s DNS name when mounting the file system. The EC2 instance on which you mount the file system by using the mount target can resolve the mount target&#39;s DNS name to its IP address. For more information, see How it Works: Implementation Overview. Note that you can create mount targets for a file system in only one VPC, and there can be only one mount target per Availability Zone. That is, if the file system already has one or more mount targets created for it, the subnet specified in the request to add another mount target must meet the following requirements: Must belong to the same VPC as the subnets of the existing mount targets Must not be in the same Availability Zone as any of the subnets of the existing mount targets If the request satisfies the requirements, Amazon EFS does the following: Creates a new mount target in the specified subnet. Also creates a new network interface in the subnet as follows: If the request provides an IpAddress, Amazon EFS assigns that IP address to the network interface. Otherwise, Amazon EFS assigns a free address in the subnet (in the same way that the Amazon EC2 CreateNetworkInterface call does when a request does not specify a primary private IP address). If the request provides SecurityGroups, this network interface is associated with those security groups. Otherwise, it belongs to the default security group for the subnet&#39;s VPC. Assigns the description Mount target *fsmt-id* for file system *fs-id* where *fsmt-id* is the mount target ID, and *fs-id* is the FileSystemId. Sets the requesterManaged property of the network interface to true, and the requesterId value to EFS. Each Amazon EFS mount target has one corresponding requester-managed EC2 network interface. After the network interface is created, Amazon EFS sets the NetworkInterfaceId field in the mount target&#39;s description to the network interface ID, and the IpAddress field to its address. If network interface creation fails, the entire CreateMountTarget operation fails. The CreateMountTarget call returns only after creating the network interface, but while the mount target state is still creating, you can check the mount target creation status by calling the DescribeMountTargets operation, which among other things returns the mount target state. We recommend that you create a mount target in each of the Availability Zones. There are cost considerations for using a file system in an Availability Zone through a mount target created in another Availability Zone. For more information, see Amazon EFS. In addition, by always using a mount target local to the instance&#39;s Availability Zone, you eliminate a partial failure scenario.

This enables you to increase the availability of your application. The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered instances and ensures that it routes traffic only to healthy instances. You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by specifying one or more listeners, which are configured with a protocol and port number for connections from clients to the load balancer and a protocol and port number for connections from the load balancer to the instances. Elastic Load Balancing supports three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. You can select a load balancer based on your application needs. For more information, see the Elastic Load Balancing User Guide. This reference covers the 2012-06-01 API, which supports Classic Load Balancers. The 2015-12-01 API supports Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers. To get started, create a load balancer with one or more listeners using CreateLoadBalancer. Register your instances with the load balancer using RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer.

This enables you to increase the availability of your application. The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered targets and ensures that it routes traffic only to healthy targets. You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by specifying one or more listeners, which are configured with a protocol and port number for connections from clients to the load balancer. You configure a target group with a protocol and port number for connections from the load balancer to the targets, and with health check settings to be used when checking the health status of the targets. Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. This reference covers Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers. An Application Load Balancer makes routing and load balancing decisions at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS). A Network Load Balancer makes routing and load balancing decisions at the transport layer (TCP/TLS). Both Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers can route requests to one or more ports on each EC2 instance or container instance in your virtual private cloud (VPC).

For more information, see Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS Accounts in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide.

Rules are enabled by default, or based on value of the state. You can disable a rule using DisableRule. A single rule watches for events from a single event bus. Events generated by AWS services go to your account&#39;s default event bus. Events generated by SaaS partner services or applications go to the matching partner event bus. If you have custom applications or services, you can specify whether their events go to your default event bus or a custom event bus that you have created. For more information, see CreateEventBus. If you are updating an existing rule, the rule is replaced with what you specify in this PutRule command. If you omit arguments in PutRule, the old values for those arguments are not kept. Instead, they are replaced with null values. When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately start matching to new or updated rules. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect. A rule must contain at least an EventPattern or ScheduleExpression. Rules with EventPatterns are triggered when a matching event is observed. Rules with ScheduleExpressions self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule can have both an EventPattern and a ScheduleExpression, in which case the rule triggers on matching events as well as on a schedule. When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one or more tags to the rule. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only rules with certain tag values. To use the PutRule operation and assign tags, you must have both the events:PutRule and events:TagResource permissions. If you are updating an existing rule, any tags you specify in the PutRule operation are ignored. To update the tags of an existing rule, use TagResource and UntagResource. Most services in AWS treat : or / as the same character in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). However, EventBridge uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to match. In EventBridge, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to change them to the desired state. If the rule is not written carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an infinite loop. To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not re-fire the same rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change. An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed your specified limit. For more information, see Managing Your Costs with Budgets."},{"ref":"AWS.EventBridge.html#put_targets/3","title":"AWS.EventBridge.put_targets/3","type":"function","doc":"Adds the specified targets to the specified rule, or updates the targets if they are already associated with the rule. Targets are the resources that are invoked when a rule is triggered. You can configure the following as targets for Events: EC2 instances SSM Run Command SSM Automation AWS Lambda functions Data streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Data delivery streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Amazon ECS tasks AWS Step Functions state machines AWS Batch jobs AWS CodeBuild projects Pipelines in AWS CodePipeline Amazon Inspector assessment templates Amazon SNS topics Amazon SQS queues, including FIFO queues The default event bus of another AWS account Amazon API Gateway REST APIs Redshift Clusters to invoke Data API ExecuteStatement on Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the AWS Management Console. The built-in targets are EC2 CreateSnapshot API call, EC2 RebootInstances API call, EC2 StopInstances API call, and EC2 TerminateInstances API call. For some target types, PutTargets provides target-specific parameters. If the target is a Kinesis data stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the KinesisParameters argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the RunCommandParameters field. To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) needs the appropriate permissions. For AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, EventBridge relies on resource-based policies. For EC2 instances, Kinesis data streams, AWS Step Functions state machines and API Gateway REST APIs, EventBridge relies on IAM roles that you specify in the RoleARN argument in PutTargets. For more information, see Authentication and Access Control in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide. If another AWS account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using PutPermission), you can send events to that account. Set that account&#39;s event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To send the matched events to the other account, specify that account&#39;s event bus as the Arn value when you run PutTargets. If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event is not charged. For more information, see Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) Pricing. Input, InputPath, and InputTransformer are not available with PutTarget if the target is an event bus of a different AWS account. If you are setting the event bus of another account as the target, and that account granted permission to your account through an organization instead of directly by the account ID, then you must specify a RoleArn with proper permissions in the Target structure. For more information, see Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS Accounts in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide. For more information about enabling cross-account events, see PutPermission. Input, InputPath, and InputTransformer are mutually exclusive and optional parameters of a target. When a rule is triggered due to a matched event: If none of the following arguments are specified for a target, then the entire event is passed to the target in JSON format (unless the target is Amazon EC2 Run Command or Amazon ECS task, in which case nothing from the event is passed to the target). If Input is specified in the form of valid JSON, then the matched event is overridden with this constant. If InputPath is specified in the form of JSONPath (for example, $.detail), then only the part of the event specified in the path is passed to the target (for example, only the detail part of the event is passed). If InputTransformer is specified, then one or more specified JSONPaths are extracted from the event and used as values in a template that you specify as the input to the target. When you specify InputPath or InputTransformer, you must use JSON dot notation, not bracket notation. When you add targets to a rule and the associated rule triggers soon after, new or updated targets might not be immediately invoked. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.

By default, you can create up to 50 delivery streams per AWS Region. This is an asynchronous operation that immediately returns. The initial status of the delivery stream is CREATING. After the delivery stream is created, its status is ACTIVE and it now accepts data. If the delivery stream creation fails, the status transitions to CREATING_FAILED. Attempts to send data to a delivery stream that is not in the ACTIVE state cause an exception. To check the state of a delivery stream, use DescribeDeliveryStream. If the status of a delivery stream is CREATING_FAILED, this status doesn&#39;t change, and you can&#39;t invoke CreateDeliveryStream again on it. However, you can invoke the DeleteDeliveryStream operation to delete it. A Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream can be configured to receive records directly from providers using PutRecord or PutRecordBatch, or it can be configured to use an existing Kinesis stream as its source. To specify a Kinesis data stream as input, set the DeliveryStreamType parameter to KinesisStreamAsSource, and provide the Kinesis stream Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and role ARN in the KinesisStreamSourceConfiguration parameter. To create a delivery stream with server-side encryption (SSE) enabled, include DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfigurationInput in your request. This is optional. You can also invoke StartDeliveryStreamEncryption to turn on SSE for an existing delivery stream that doesn&#39;t have SSE enabled. A delivery stream is configured with a single destination: Amazon S3, Amazon ES, Amazon Redshift, or Splunk. You must specify only one of the following destination configuration parameters: ExtendedS3DestinationConfiguration, S3DestinationConfiguration, ElasticsearchDestinationConfiguration, RedshiftDestinationConfiguration, or SplunkDestinationConfiguration. When you specify S3DestinationConfiguration, you can also provide the following optional values: BufferingHints, EncryptionConfiguration, and CompressionFormat. By default, if no BufferingHints value is provided, Kinesis Data Firehose buffers data up to 5 MB or for 5 minutes, whichever condition is satisfied first. BufferingHints is a hint, so there are some cases where the service cannot adhere to these conditions strictly. For example, record boundaries might be such that the size is a little over or under the configured buffering size. By default, no encryption is performed. We strongly recommend that you enable encryption to ensure secure data storage in Amazon S3. A few notes about Amazon Redshift as a destination: An Amazon Redshift destination requires an S3 bucket as intermediate location. Kinesis Data Firehose first delivers data to Amazon S3 and then uses COPY syntax to load data into an Amazon Redshift table. This is specified in the RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration parameter. The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified in RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration because the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3 bucket doesn&#39;t support these compression formats. We strongly recommend that you use the user name and password you provide exclusively with Kinesis Data Firehose, and that the permissions for the account are restricted for Amazon Redshift INSERT permissions. Kinesis Data Firehose assumes the IAM role that is configured as part of the destination. The role should allow the Kinesis Data Firehose principal to assume the role, and the role should have permissions that allow the service to deliver the data.

For more information about limits and how to request an increase, see Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Limits. You must specify the name of the delivery stream and the data record when using PutRecord.

The PutRecordBatch response includes a count of failed records, FailedPutCount, and an array of responses, RequestResponses. Even if the PutRecordBatch call succeeds, the value of FailedPutCount may be greater than 0, indicating that there are records for which the operation didn&#39;t succeed. Each entry in the RequestResponses array provides additional information about the processed record. It directly correlates with a record in the request array using the same ordering, from the top to the bottom. The response array always includes the same number of records as the request array. RequestResponses includes both successfully and unsuccessfully processed records. Kinesis Data Firehose tries to process all records in each PutRecordBatch request. A single record failure does not stop the processing of subsequent records. A successfully processed record includes a RecordId value, which is unique for the record. An unsuccessfully processed record includes ErrorCode and ErrorMessage values. ErrorCode reflects the type of error, and is one of the following values: ServiceUnavailableException or InternalFailure. ErrorMessage provides more detailed information about the error. If there is an internal server error or a timeout, the write might have completed or it might have failed. If FailedPutCount is greater than 0, retry the request, resending only those records that might have failed processing. This minimizes the possible duplicate records and also reduces the total bytes sent (and corresponding charges). We recommend that you handle any duplicates at the destination.

Use this operation to change the destination type (for example, to replace the Amazon S3 destination with Amazon Redshift) or change the parameters associated with a destination (for example, to change the bucket name of the Amazon S3 destination). The update might not occur immediately. The target delivery stream remains active while the configurations are updated, so data writes to the delivery stream can continue during this process. The updated configurations are usually effective within a few minutes. Switching between Amazon ES and other services is not supported. For an Amazon ES destination, you can only update to another Amazon ES destination. If the destination type is the same, Kinesis Data Firehose merges the configuration parameters specified with the destination configuration that already exists on the delivery stream. If any of the parameters are not specified in the call, the existing values are retained. For example, in the Amazon S3 destination, if EncryptionConfiguration is not specified, then the existing EncryptionConfiguration is maintained on the destination. If the destination type is not the same, for example, changing the destination from Amazon S3 to Amazon Redshift, Kinesis Data Firehose does not merge any parameters. In this case, all parameters must be specified. Kinesis Data Firehose uses CurrentDeliveryStreamVersionId to avoid race conditions and conflicting merges. This is a required field, and the service updates the configuration only if the existing configuration has a version ID that matches. After the update is applied successfully, the version ID is updated, and can be retrieved using DescribeDeliveryStream.

A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit. When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error. To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status PLACING, where a new game session is created for the match. If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where one or more players rejected the match, the ticket status is returned to SEARCHING to find a new match. For tickets where one or more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to CANCELLED, and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as needed.

Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host gameplay and players. This operation is called from a game client or client service (such as a matchmaker) to request hosting resources for a new game session. In response, GameLift FleetIQ locates an available game server, places it in CLAIMED status for 60 seconds, and returns connection information that players can use to connect to the game server. To claim a game server, identify a game server group. You can also specify a game server ID, although this approach bypasses GameLift FleetIQ placement optimization. Optionally, include game data to pass to the game server at the start of a game session, such as a game map or player information. When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A claimed game server&#39;s utilization status remains AVAILABLE while the claim status is set to CLAIMED for up to 60 seconds. This time period gives the game server time to update its status to UTILIZED (using UpdateGameServer) once players join. If the game server&#39;s status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another request. The claim time period is a fixed value and is not configurable.

In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for a fleet that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when updating your game build. Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site. To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases.

The CreateBuild operation can used in the following scenarios: To create a new game build with build files that are in an S3 location under an AWS account that you control. To use this option, you must first give Amazon GameLift access to the S3 bucket.

Destination order. When processing a request for a game session, Amazon GameLift tries each destination in order until it finds one with available resources to host the new game session. A queue&#39;s default order is determined by how destinations are listed. The default order is overridden when a game session placement request provides player latency information. Player latency information enables Amazon GameLift to prioritize destinations where players report the lowest average latency, as a result placing the new game session where the majority of players will have the best possible gameplay experience. Player latency policies. For placement requests containing player latency information, use player latency policies to protect individual players from very high latencies. With a latency cap, even when a destination can deliver a low latency for most players, the game is not placed where any individual player is reporting latency higher than a policy&#39;s maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies, which are enforced consecutively starting with the policy with the lowest latency cap.

Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet&#39;s hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet&#39;s capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences. You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling StopFleetActions with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call StartFleetActions with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove it, you must delete the policy with DeleteScalingPolicy. Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling. Target-based policy A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet&#39;s hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet&#39;s buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target. For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet&#39;s available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer. To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to &quot;TargetBased&quot;. Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a TargetConfiguration object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it&#39;s successfully created. If the fleet&#39;s auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted. Rule-based policy A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. For example, a policy may make the following statement: &quot;If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%.&quot; A policy&#39;s rule statement has the following structure: If [MetricName] is [ComparisonOperator] [Threshold] for [EvaluationPeriods] minutes, then [ScalingAdjustmentType] to/by [ScalingAdjustment]. To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this: If [PercentIdleInstances] is [GreaterThanThreshold] [20] for [15] minutes, then [PercentChangeInCapacity] to/by [10]. To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to &quot;RuleBased&quot;. Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they&#39;re successfully created. If the fleet&#39;s auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.

When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift searches for available resources on the queue&#39;s destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement request times out. A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each player included in the request. When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue&#39;s destinations are listed in preference order. Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency data for each player in relevant Regions. Latency data indicates the performance lag a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the Region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a Region with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift calculates each Region&#39;s average lag for all players and reorders to get the best game play across all players. To place a new game session request, specify the following: The queue name and a set of game session properties and settings A unique ID (such as a UUID) for the placement. You use this ID to track the status of the placement request (Optional) A set of player data and a unique player ID for each player that you are joining to the new game session (player data is optional, but if you include it, you must also provide a unique ID for each player) Latency data for all players (if you want to optimize game play for the players) If successful, a new game session placement is created. To track the status of a placement request, call DescribeGameSessionPlacement and check the request&#39;s status. If the status is FULFILLED, a new game session has been created and a game session ARN and Region are referenced.

By backfilling with the same matchmaker used to create the original match, you ensure that new players meet the match criteria and maintain a consistent experience throughout the game session. You can backfill a match anytime after a game session has been created. To request a match backfill, specify a unique ticket ID, the existing game session&#39;s ARN, a matchmaking configuration, and a set of data that describes all current players in the game session.

Each matchmaking request specifies the type of match to build (team configuration, rules for an acceptable match, etc.). The request also specifies the players to find a match for and where to host the new game session for optimal performance. A matchmaking request might start with a single player or a group of players who want to play together. FlexMatch finds additional players as needed to fill the match. Match type, rules, and the queue used to place a new game session are defined in a MatchmakingConfiguration. To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be matched. You must also include a set of player attributes relevant for the matchmaking configuration. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to QUEUED. Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully completed matches. Ticket status updates are tracked using event notification through Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), which is defined in the matchmaking configuration. Processing a matchmaking request -- FlexMatch handles a matchmaking request as follows: Your client code submits a StartMatchmaking request for one or more players and tracks the status of the request ticket. FlexMatch uses this ticket and others in process to build an acceptable match. When a potential match is identified, all tickets in the proposed match are advanced to the next status. If the match requires player acceptance (set in the matchmaking configuration), the tickets move into status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE. This status triggers your client code to solicit acceptance from all players in every ticket involved in the match, and then call AcceptMatch for each player. If any player rejects or fails to accept the match before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped (see AcceptMatch for more details). Once a match is proposed and accepted, the matchmaking tickets move into status PLACING. FlexMatch locates resources for a new game session using the game session queue (set in the matchmaking configuration) and creates the game session based on the match data. When the match is successfully placed, the matchmaking tickets move into COMPLETED status. Connection information (including game session endpoint and player session) is added to the matchmaking tickets. Matched players can use the connection information to join the game.

This guide is for developers who need detailed information about AWS Global Accelerator API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about Global Accelerator features, see the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide. AWS Global Accelerator is a service in which you create accelerators to improve availability and performance of your applications for local and global users. You must specify the US West (Oregon) Region to create or update accelerators. By default, Global Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses that you associate with your accelerator. (Instead of using the IP addresses that Global Accelerator provides, you can configure these entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address ranges that you bring to Global Accelerator.) The static IP addresses are anycast from the AWS edge network and distribute incoming application traffic across multiple endpoint resources in multiple AWS Regions, which increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses that are located in one AWS Region or multiple Regions. Global Accelerator uses the AWS global network to route traffic to the optimal regional endpoint based on health, client location, and policies that you configure. The service reacts instantly to changes in health or configuration to ensure that internet traffic from clients is directed to only healthy endpoints. Global Accelerator includes components that work together to help you improve performance and availability for your applications: Definitions Static IP address By default, AWS Global Accelerator provides you with a set of static IP addresses that are anycast from the AWS edge network and serve as the single fixed entry points for your clients. Or you can configure these entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address ranges that you bring to Global Accelerator (BYOIP). For more information, see Bring Your Own IP Addresses (BYOIP) in the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide. If you already have load balancers, EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses set up for your applications, you can easily add those to Global Accelerator to allow the resources to be accessed by the static IP addresses. The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you delete an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. You can use IAM policies with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator. For more information, see Authentication and Access Control in the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide. Accelerator An accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network to improve availability and performance for your internet applications that have a global audience. Each accelerator includes one or more listeners. DNS name Global Accelerator assigns each accelerator a default Domain Name System (DNS) name, similar to a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com, that points to your Global Accelerator static IP addresses. Depending on the use case, you can use your accelerator&#39;s static IP addresses or DNS name to route traffic to your accelerator, or set up DNS records to route traffic using your own custom domain name. Network zone A network zone services the static IP addresses for your accelerator from a unique IP subnet. Similar to an AWS Availability Zone, a network zone is an isolated unit with its own set of physical infrastructure. When you configure an accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator allocates two IPv4 addresses for it. If one IP address from a network zone becomes unavailable due to IP address blocking by certain client networks, or network disruptions, then client applications can retry on the healthy static IP address from the other isolated network zone. Listener A listener processes inbound connections from clients to Global Accelerator, based on the protocol and port that you configure. Each listener has one or more endpoint groups associated with it, and traffic is forwarded to endpoints in one of the groups. You associate endpoint groups with listeners by specifying the Regions that you want to distribute traffic to. Traffic is distributed to optimal endpoints within the endpoint groups associated with a listener. Endpoint group Each endpoint group is associated with a specific AWS Region. Endpoint groups include one or more endpoints in the Region. You can increase or reduce the percentage of traffic that would be otherwise directed to an endpoint group by adjusting a setting called a traffic dial. The traffic dial lets you easily do performance testing or blue/green deployment testing for new releases across different AWS Regions, for example. Endpoint An endpoint is a Network Load Balancer, Application Load Balancer, EC2 instance, or Elastic IP address. Traffic is routed to endpoints based on several factors, including the geo-proximity to the user, the health of the endpoint, and the configuration options that you choose, such as endpoint weights. For each endpoint, you can configure weights, which are numbers that you can use to specify the proportion of traffic to route to each one. This can be useful, for example, to do performance testing within a Region."},{"ref":"AWS.GlobalAccelerator.html#advertise_byoip_cidr/3","title":"AWS.GlobalAccelerator.advertise_byoip_cidr/3","type":"function","doc":"Advertises an IPv4 address range that is provisioned for use with your AWS resources through bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP).

This can include issues like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or communication with malicious IPs, URLs, or domains. For example, GuardDuty can detect compromised EC2 instances that serve malware or mine bitcoin. GuardDuty also monitors AWS account access behavior for signs of compromise. Some examples of this are unauthorized infrastructure deployments such as EC2 instances deployed in a Region that has never been used, or unusual API calls like a password policy change to reduce password strength.

To generate a service last accessed data report for policies, specify an entity path and the optional AWS Organizations policy ID. The type of entity that you specify determines the data returned for each service. Root – When you specify the root entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in your organization to which the SCP applies. This data excludes the master account, because the master account is not limited by SCPs. If the SCP is not attached to any entities in the organization, then the report will return a list of services with no data. OU – When you specify an OU entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in the OU or its children to which the SCP applies. This means that other accounts outside the OU that are affected by the SCP might not be included in the data. This data excludes the master account, because the master account is not limited by SCPs. If the SCP is not attached to the OU or one of its children, the report will return a list of services with no data. Master account – When you specify the master account, the resulting report lists all AWS services, because the master account is not limited by SCPs. If you specify a policy ID in the CLI or API, the policy is ignored. For each service, the report includes data for only the master account. Account – When you specify another account entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for only the specified account. This means that other accounts in the organization that are affected by the SCP might not be included in the data. If the SCP is not attached to the account, the report will return a list of services with no data. Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining whether a principal could access a service. These other policy types include identity-based policies, resource-based policies, access control lists, IAM permissions boundaries, and STS assume role policies. It only applies SCP logic.

Refer to your CloudTrail logs as the authoritative source for information about all API calls and whether they were successful or denied access. For more information, see Logging IAM Events with CloudTrail in the IAM User Guide. The GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails operation returns a JobId. Use this parameter in the following operations to retrieve the following details from your report: GetServiceLastAccessedDetails – Use this operation for users, groups, roles, or policies to list every AWS service that the resource could access using permissions policies. For each service, the response includes information about the most recent access attempt. The JobId returned by GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetail must be used by the same role within a session, or by the same user when used to call GetServiceLastAccessedDetail.

Traditional analytics and business intelligence tools are designed to process structured data. IoT data often comes from devices that record noisy processes (such as temperature, motion, or sound). As a result the data from these devices can have significant gaps, corrupted messages, and false readings that must be cleaned up before analysis can occur. Also, IoT data is often only meaningful in the context of other data from external sources. AWS IoT Analytics automates the steps required to analyze data from IoT devices. AWS IoT Analytics filters, transforms, and enriches IoT data before storing it in a time-series data store for analysis. You can set up the service to collect only the data you need from your devices, apply mathematical transforms to process the data, and enrich the data with device-specific metadata such as device type and location before storing it. Then, you can analyze your data by running queries using the built-in SQL query engine, or perform more complex analytics and machine learning inference.

JSON is used for both requests and responses, including errors. The API is an AWS regional service, currently in these regions: us-west-2, us-east-1, and eu-west-1. All API request parameters and URLs are case sensitive. * For a summary of notable documentation changes in each release, see Document History. Service Endpoints The following are the Amazon IVS service endpoints (all HTTPS): Region name: US West (Oregon) Region: us-west-2 Endpoint: ivs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com Region name: US East (Virginia) Region: us-east-1 Endpoint: ivs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com Region name: EU West (Dublin) Region: eu-west-1 Endpoint: ivs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com Allowed Header Values **Accept:** application/json **Accept-Encoding:** gzip, deflate **Content-Type:**application/json Resources The following resources contain information about your IVS live stream (see Getting Started with Amazon IVS): Channel — Stores configuration data related to your live stream. You first create a channel and then use the channel’s stream key to start your live stream. See the Channel endpoints for more information. Stream key — An identifier assigned by Amazon IVS when you create a channel, which is then used to authorize streaming. See the StreamKey endpoints for more information. Treat the stream key like a secret, since it allows anyone to stream to the channel. Playback key pair — Video playback may be restricted using playback-authorization tokens, which use public-key encryption. A playback key pair is the public-private pair of keys used to sign and validate the playback-authorization token. See the PlaybackKeyPair endpoints for more information. Tagging A tag is a metadata label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag comprises a key and a value, both set by you. For example, you might set a tag as topic:nature to label a particular video category. See Tagging AWS Resources for more information, including restrictions that apply to tags. Tags can help you identify and organize your AWS resources. For example, you can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that they are related. You can also use tags to manage access (see Access Tags). The Amazon IVS API has these tag-related endpoints: TagResource, UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource. The following resources support tagging: Channels, Stream Keys, and Playback Key Pairs. Channel Endpoints CreateChannel — Creates a new channel and an associated stream key to start streaming. GetChannel — Gets the channel configuration for the specified channel ARN (Amazon Resource Name). BatchGetChannel — Performs GetChannel on multiple ARNs simultaneously. ListChannels — Gets summary information about all channels in your account, in the AWS region where the API request is processed. This list can be filtered to match a specified string. UpdateChannel — Updates a channel&#39;s configuration. This does not affect an ongoing stream of this channel. You must stop and restart the stream for the changes to take effect. DeleteChannel — Deletes the specified channel. StreamKey Endpoints CreateStreamKey — Creates a stream key, used to initiate a stream, for the specified channel ARN. GetStreamKey — Gets stream key information for the specified ARN. BatchGetStreamKey — Performs GetStreamKey on multiple ARNs simultaneously. ListStreamKeys — Gets summary information about stream keys for the specified channel. DeleteStreamKey — Deletes the stream key for the specified ARN, so it can no longer be used to stream. Stream Endpoints GetStream — Gets information about the active (live) stream on a specified channel. ListStreams — Gets summary information about live streams in your account, in the AWS region where the API request is processed. StopStream — Disconnects the incoming RTMPS stream for the specified channel. Can be used in conjunction with DeleteStreamKey to prevent further streaming to a channel. PutMetadata — Inserts metadata into an RTMPS stream for the specified channel. A maximum of 5 requests per second per channel is allowed, each with a maximum 1KB payload. PlaybackKeyPair Endpoints ImportPlaybackKeyPair — Imports the public portion of a new key pair and returns its arn and fingerprint. The privateKey can then be used to generate viewer authorization tokens, to grant viewers access to authorized channels. GetPlaybackKeyPair — Gets a specified playback authorization key pair and returns the arn and fingerprint. The privateKey held by the caller can be used to generate viewer authorization tokens, to grant viewers access to authorized channels. ListPlaybackKeyPairs — Gets summary information about playback key pairs. DeletePlaybackKeyPair — Deletes a specified authorization key pair. This invalidates future viewer tokens generated using the key pair’s privateKey. AWS Tags Endpoints TagResource — Adds or updates tags for the AWS resource with the specified ARN. UntagResource — Removes tags from the resource with the specified ARN. ListTagsForResource — Gets information about AWS tags for the specified ARN."},{"ref":"AWS.Ivs.html#batch_get_channel/3","title":"AWS.Ivs.batch_get_channel/3","type":"function","doc":"Performs GetChannel on multiple ARNs simultaneously."},{"ref":"AWS.Ivs.html#batch_get_stream_key/3","title":"AWS.Ivs.batch_get_stream_key/3","type":"function","doc":"Performs GetStreamKey on multiple ARNs simultaneously."},{"ref":"AWS.Ivs.html#create_channel/3","title":"AWS.Ivs.create_channel/3","type":"function","doc":"Creates a new channel and an associated stream key to start streaming."},{"ref":"AWS.Ivs.html#create_stream_key/3","title":"AWS.Ivs.create_stream_key/3","type":"function","doc":"Creates a stream key, used to initiate a stream, for the specified channel ARN.

This guide describes the AWS KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about AWS KMS, see the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide . AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS and other AWS services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services. We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to AWS KMS. Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes. Signing Requests Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account (root) access key ID and secret key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user. You can also use the AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials that you can use to sign requests. All AWS KMS operations require Signature Version 4. Logging API Requests AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and related events for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to AWS KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide. Additional Resources For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following: AWS Security Credentials - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials used for accessing AWS. Temporary Security Credentials - This section of the IAM User Guide describes how to create and use temporary security credentials. Signature Version 4 Signing Process - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using an access key ID and a secret access key. Commonly Used API Operations Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most applications.

The custom key store must be connected before you can create customer master keys (CMKs) in the key store or use the CMKs it contains. You can disconnect and reconnect a custom key store at any time. To connect a custom key store, its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster must have at least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use the DescribeClusters operation. To add HSMs to the cluster, use the CreateHsm operation. Also, the kmsuser crypto user (CU) must not be logged into the cluster. This prevents AWS KMS from using this account to log in. The connection process can take an extended amount of time to complete; up to 20 minutes. This operation starts the connection process, but it does not wait for it to complete. When it succeeds, this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties. However, this response does not indicate that the custom key store is connected. To get the connection state of the custom key store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.

You can use an alias to identify a CMK in cryptographic operations, such as Encrypt and GenerateDataKey. You can change the CMK associated with the alias at any time. Aliases are easier to remember than key IDs. They can also help to simplify your applications. For example, if you use an alias in your code, you can change the CMK your code uses by associating a given alias with a different CMK. To run the same code in multiple AWS regions, use an alias in your code, such as alias/ApplicationKey. Then, in each AWS Region, create an alias/ApplicationKey alias that is associated with a CMK in that Region. When you run your code, it uses the alias/ApplicationKey CMK for that AWS Region without any Region-specific code. This operation does not return a response. To get the alias that you created, use the ListAliases operation. To use aliases successfully, be aware of the following information. Each alias points to only one CMK at a time, although a single CMK can have multiple aliases. The alias and its associated CMK must be in the same AWS account and Region. You can associate an alias with any customer managed CMK in the same AWS account and Region. However, you do not have permission to associate an alias with an AWS managed CMK or an AWS owned CMK. To change the CMK associated with an alias, use the UpdateAlias operation. The current CMK and the new CMK must be the same type (both symmetric or both asymmetric) and they must have the same key usage (ENCRYPT_DECRYPT or SIGN_VERIFY). This restriction prevents cryptographic errors in code that uses aliases. The alias name must begin with alias/ followed by a name, such as alias/ExampleAlias. It can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores (_), and dashes (-). The alias name cannot begin with alias/aws/. The alias/aws/ prefix is reserved for AWS managed CMKs. The alias name must be unique within an AWS Region. However, you can use the same alias name in multiple Regions of the same AWS account. Each instance of the alias is associated with a CMK in its Region. After you create an alias, you cannot change its alias name. However, you can use the DeleteAlias operation to delete the alias and then create a new alias with the desired name. You can use an alias name or alias ARN to identify a CMK in AWS KMS cryptographic operations and in the DescribeKey operation. However, you cannot use alias names or alias ARNs in API operations that manage CMKs, such as DisableKey or GetKeyPolicy. For information about the valid CMK identifiers for each AWS KMS API operation, see the descriptions of the KeyId parameter in the API operation documentation. Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can delete and change the aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the DescribeKey operation. To get the aliases and alias ARNs of CMKs in each AWS account and Region, use the ListAliases operation. The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.

You can create grants on symmetric and asymmetric CMKs. However, if the grant allows an operation that the CMK does not support, CreateGrant fails with a ValidationException. Grants for symmetric CMKs cannot allow operations that are not supported for symmetric CMKs, including Sign, Verify, and GetPublicKey.

You cannot use this operation to create a CMK in a different AWS account. You can use the CreateKey operation to create symmetric or asymmetric CMKs. Symmetric CMKs contain a 256-bit symmetric key that never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. To use the CMK, you must call AWS KMS. You can use a symmetric CMK to encrypt and decrypt small amounts of data, but they are typically used to generate data keys and data keys pairs. For details, see GenerateDataKey and GenerateDataKeyPair. Asymmetric CMKs can contain an RSA key pair or an Elliptic Curve (ECC) key pair. The private key in an asymmetric CMK never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. However, you can use the GetPublicKey operation to download the public key so it can be used outside of AWS KMS. CMKs with RSA key pairs can be used to encrypt or decrypt data or sign and verify messages (but not both). CMKs with ECC key pairs can be used only to sign and verify messages. For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. To create different types of CMKs, use the following guidance: Definitions Asymmetric CMKs To create an asymmetric CMK, use the CustomerMasterKeySpec parameter to specify the type of key material in the CMK. Then, use the KeyUsage parameter to determine whether the CMK will be used to encrypt and decrypt or sign and verify. You can&#39;t change these properties after the CMK is created. Symmetric CMKs When creating a symmetric CMK, you don&#39;t need to specify the CustomerMasterKeySpec or KeyUsage parameters. The default value for CustomerMasterKeySpec, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT, and the default value for KeyUsage, ENCRYPT_DECRYPT, are the only valid values for symmetric CMKs. Imported Key Material To import your own key material, begin by creating a symmetric CMK with no key material. To do this, use the Origin parameter of CreateKey with a value of EXTERNAL.

You can use this operation to change the customer master key (CMK) under which data is encrypted, such as when you manually rotate a CMK or change the CMK that protects a ciphertext. You can also use it to reencrypt ciphertext under the same CMK, such as to change the encryption context of a ciphertext. The ReEncrypt operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using an AWS KMS CMK in an AWS KMS operation, such as Encrypt or GenerateDataKey. It can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using the public key of an asymmetric CMK outside of AWS KMS. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the AWS Encryption SDK or Amazon S3 client-side encryption. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with AWS KMS. When you use the ReEncrypt operation, you need to provide information for the decrypt operation and the subsequent encrypt operation. If your ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric CMK, you must identify the source CMK, that is, the CMK that encrypted the ciphertext. You must also supply the encryption algorithm that was used. This information is required to decrypt the data. It is optional, but you can specify a source CMK even when the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric CMK. This ensures that the ciphertext is decrypted only by using a particular CMK. If the CMK that you specify cannot decrypt the ciphertext, the ReEncrypt operation fails. To reencrypt the data, you must specify the destination CMK, that is, the CMK that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted. You can select a symmetric or asymmetric CMK. If the destination CMK is an asymmetric CMK, you must also provide the encryption algorithm. The algorithm that you choose must be compatible with the CMK. When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the same CMK and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the CMK and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails. You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob. AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields. Unlike other AWS KMS API operations, ReEncrypt callers must have two permissions: kms:ReEncryptFrom permission on the source CMK kms:ReEncryptTo permission on the destination CMK To permit reencryption from or to a CMK, include the &quot;kms:ReEncrypt*&quot; permission in your key policy. This permission is automatically included in the key policy when you use the console to create a CMK. But you must include it manually when you create a CMK programmatically or when you use the PutKeyPolicy operation to set a key policy.

After the waiting period ends, AWS KMS deletes the CMK and all AWS KMS data associated with it, including all aliases that refer to it. Deleting a CMK is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation. When a CMK is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the CMK is unrecoverable. To prevent the use of a CMK without deleting it, use DisableKey. If you schedule deletion of a CMK from a custom key store, when the waiting period expires, ScheduleKeyDeletion deletes the CMK from AWS KMS.

Digital signatures are generated and verified by using asymmetric key pair, such as an RSA or ECC pair that is represented by an asymmetric customer master key (CMK).

Anyone with the public key can verify that the message was signed with that particular private key and that the message hasn&#39;t changed since it was signed. To use the Sign operation, provide the following information: Use the KeyId parameter to identify an asymmetric CMK with a KeyUsage value of SIGN_VERIFY.

If there are no records available in the portion of the shard that the iterator points to, GetRecords returns an empty list. It might take multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that contains records. You can scale by provisioning multiple shards per stream while considering service limits (for more information, see Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Limits in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide). Your application should have one thread per shard, each reading continuously from its stream. To read from a stream continually, call GetRecords in a loop. Use GetShardIterator to get the shard iterator to specify in the first GetRecords call. GetRecords returns a new shard iterator in NextShardIterator. Specify the shard iterator returned in NextShardIterator in subsequent calls to GetRecords. If the shard has been closed, the shard iterator can&#39;t return more data and GetRecords returns null in NextShardIterator. You can terminate the loop when the shard is closed, or when the shard iterator reaches the record with the sequence number or other attribute that marks it as the last record to process. Each data record can be up to 1 MiB in size, and each shard can read up to 2 MiB per second. You can ensure that your calls don&#39;t exceed the maximum supported size or throughput by using the Limit parameter to specify the maximum number of records that GetRecords can return. Consider your average record size when determining this limit. The maximum number of records that can be returned per call is 10,000. The size of the data returned by GetRecords varies depending on the utilization of the shard. The maximum size of data that GetRecords can return is 10 MiB. If a call returns this amount of data, subsequent calls made within the next 5 seconds throw ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. If there is insufficient provisioned throughput on the stream, subsequent calls made within the next 1 second throw ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. GetRecords doesn&#39;t return any data when it throws an exception. For this reason, we recommend that you wait 1 second between calls to GetRecords. However, it&#39;s possible that the application will get exceptions for longer than 1 second. To detect whether the application is falling behind in processing, you can use the MillisBehindLatest response attribute. You can also monitor the stream using CloudWatch metrics and other mechanisms (see Monitoring in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide). Each Amazon Kinesis record includes a value, ApproximateArrivalTimestamp, that is set when a stream successfully receives and stores a record. This is commonly referred to as a server-side time stamp, whereas a client-side time stamp is set when a data producer creates or sends the record to a stream (a data producer is any data source putting data records into a stream, for example with PutRecords). The time stamp has millisecond precision. There are no guarantees about the time stamp accuracy, or that the time stamp is always increasing. For example, records in a shard or across a stream might have time stamps that are out of order.

You must specify the shard iterator type. For example, you can set the ShardIteratorType parameter to read exactly from the position denoted by a specific sequence number by using the AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER shard iterator type. Alternatively, the parameter can read right after the sequence number by using the AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER shard iterator type, using sequence numbers returned by earlier calls to PutRecord, PutRecords, GetRecords, or DescribeStream.

You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; a partition key; and the data blob itself. The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment from a log file, geographic/location data, website clickstream data, and so on. The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams to distribute data across shards. Kinesis Data Streams segregates the data records that belong to a stream into multiple shards, using the partition key associated with each data record to determine the shard to which a given data record belongs. Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each key. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the shards. You can override hashing the partition key to determine the shard by explicitly specifying a hash value using the ExplicitHashKey parameter. For more information, see Adding Data to a Stream in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide.

Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per second.

The record size limit applies to the total size of the partition key and data blob. The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment from a log file, geographic/location data, website clickstream data, and so on. The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams as input to a hash function that maps the partition key and associated data to a specific shard. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism, all data records with the same partition key map to the same shard within the stream. For more information, see Adding Data to a Stream in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide. Each record in the Records array may include an optional parameter, ExplicitHashKey, which overrides the partition key to shard mapping. This parameter allows a data producer to determine explicitly the shard where the record is stored. For more information, see Adding Multiple Records with PutRecords in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide. The PutRecords response includes an array of response Records. Each record in the response array directly correlates with a record in the request array using natural ordering, from the top to the bottom of the request and response. The response Records array always includes the same number of records as the request array. The response Records array includes both successfully and unsuccessfully processed records. Kinesis Data Streams attempts to process all records in each PutRecords request. A single record failure does not stop the processing of subsequent records. As a result, PutRecords doesn&#39;t guarantee the ordering of records. If you need to read records in the same order they are written to the stream, use PutRecord instead of PutRecords, and write to the same shard. A successfully processed record includes ShardId and SequenceNumber values. The ShardId parameter identifies the shard in the stream where the record is stored. The SequenceNumber parameter is an identifier assigned to the put record, unique to all records in the stream. An unsuccessfully processed record includes ErrorCode and ErrorMessage values. ErrorCode reflects the type of error and can be one of the following values: ProvisionedThroughputExceededException or InternalFailure. ErrorMessage provides more detailed information about the ProvisionedThroughputExceededException exception including the account ID, stream name, and shard ID of the record that was throttled.

You can use one of the output configurations to deliver data from your in-application error stream to an external destination so that you can analyze the errors. For more information, see Understanding Application Output (Destination). Any configuration update, including adding a streaming source using this operation, results in a new version of the application. You can use the DescribeApplication operation to find the current application version. For the limits on the number of application inputs and outputs you can configure, see Limits.

You can configure each application with one streaming source as input, application code to process the input, and up to three destinations where you want Amazon Kinesis Analytics to write the output data from your application. For an overview, see How it Works. In the input configuration, you map the streaming source to an in-application stream, which you can think of as a constantly updating table. In the mapping, you must provide a schema for the in-application stream and map each data column in the in-application stream to a data element in the streaming source. Your application code is one or more SQL statements that read input data, transform it, and generate output. Your application code can create one or more SQL artifacts like SQL streams or pumps. In the output configuration, you can configure the application to write data from in-application streams created in your applications to up to three destinations.

An Amazon Kinesis video stream has the following requirements for providing data through MPEG-DASH: The media must contain h.264 or h.265 encoded video and, optionally, AAC or G.711 encoded audio. Specifically, the codec ID of track 1 should be V_MPEG/ISO/AVC (for h.264) or V_MPEGH/ISO/HEVC (for H.265). Optionally, the codec ID of track 2 should be A_AAC (for AAC) or A_MS/ACM (for G.711). Data retention must be greater than 0. The video track of each fragment must contain codec private data in the Advanced Video Coding (AVC) for H.264 format and HEVC for H.265 format. For more information, see MPEG-4 specification ISO/IEC 14496-15. For information about adapting stream data to a given format, see NAL Adaptation Flags. The audio track (if present) of each fragment must contain codec private data in the AAC format (AAC specification ISO/IEC 13818-7) or the MS Wave format. The following procedure shows how to use MPEG-DASH with Kinesis Video Streams: Get an endpoint using GetDataEndpoint, specifying GET_DASH_STREAMING_SESSION_URL for the APIName parameter. Retrieve the MPEG-DASH URL using GetDASHStreamingSessionURL. Kinesis Video Streams creates an MPEG-DASH streaming session to be used for accessing content in a stream using the MPEG-DASH protocol. GetDASHStreamingSessionURL returns an authenticated URL (that includes an encrypted session token) for the session&#39;s MPEG-DASH manifest (the root resource needed for streaming with MPEG-DASH). Don&#39;t share or store this token where an unauthorized entity could access it. The token provides access to the content of the stream. Safeguard the token with the same measures that you would use with your AWS credentials. The media that is made available through the manifest consists only of the requested stream, time range, and format. No other media data (such as frames outside the requested window or alternate bitrates) is made available. Provide the URL (containing the encrypted session token) for the MPEG-DASH manifest to a media player that supports the MPEG-DASH protocol. Kinesis Video Streams makes the initialization fragment and media fragments available through the manifest URL. The initialization fragment contains the codec private data for the stream, and other data needed to set up the video or audio decoder and renderer. The media fragments contain encoded video frames or encoded audio samples. The media player receives the authenticated URL and requests stream metadata and media data normally. When the media player requests data, it calls the following actions: GetDASHManifest: Retrieves an MPEG DASH manifest, which contains the metadata for the media that you want to playback. GetMP4InitFragment: Retrieves the MP4 initialization fragment. The media player typically loads the initialization fragment before loading any media fragments. This fragment contains the &quot;fytp&quot; and &quot;moov&quot; MP4 atoms, and the child atoms that are needed to initialize the media player decoder. The initialization fragment does not correspond to a fragment in a Kinesis video stream. It contains only the codec private data for the stream and respective track, which the media player needs to decode the media frames. * **GetMP4MediaFragment:** Retrieves MP4 media fragments. These fragments contain the &quot;moof&quot; and &quot;mdat&quot; MP4 atoms and their child atoms, containing the encoded fragment&#39;s media frames and their timestamps. After the first media fragment is made available in a streaming session, any fragments that don&#39;t contain the same codec private data cause an error to be returned when those different media fragments are loaded. Therefore, the codec private data should not change between fragments in a session. This also means that the session fails if the fragments in a stream change from having only video to having both audio and video. Data retrieved with this action is billable. See Pricing for details. The following restrictions apply to MPEG-DASH sessions: A streaming session URL should not be shared between players. The service might throttle a session if multiple media players are sharing it. For connection limits, see Kinesis Video Streams Limits. A Kinesis video stream can have a maximum of ten active MPEG-DASH streaming sessions. If a new session is created when the maximum number of sessions is already active, the oldest (earliest created) session is closed. The number of active GetMedia connections on a Kinesis video stream does not count against this limit, and the number of active MPEG-DASH sessions does not count against the active GetMedia connection limit. The maximum limits for active HLS and MPEG-DASH streaming sessions are independent of each other.

GetHLSMediaPlaylist: Retrieves an HLS media playlist, which contains a URL to access the MP4 initialization fragment with the GetMP4InitFragment action, and URLs to access the MP4 media fragments with the GetMP4MediaFragment actions. The HLS media playlist also contains metadata about the stream that the player needs to play it, such as whether the PlaybackMode is LIVE or ON_DEMAND. The HLS media playlist is typically static for sessions with a PlaybackType of ON_DEMAND. The HLS media playlist is continually updated with new fragments for sessions with a PlaybackType of LIVE.

For synchronous invocation, details about the function response, including errors, are included in the response body and headers. For either invocation type, you can find more information in the execution log and trace. When an error occurs, your function may be invoked multiple times. Retry behavior varies by error type, client, event source, and invocation type. For example, if you invoke a function asynchronously and it returns an error, Lambda executes the function up to two more times. For more information, see Retry Behavior. For asynchronous invocation, Lambda adds events to a queue before sending them to your function. If your function does not have enough capacity to keep up with the queue, events may be lost. Occasionally, your function may receive the same event multiple times, even if no error occurs. To retain events that were not processed, configure your function with a dead-letter queue. The status code in the API response doesn&#39;t reflect function errors. Error codes are reserved for errors that prevent your function from executing, such as permissions errors, limit errors, or issues with your function&#39;s code and configuration. For example, Lambda returns TooManyRequestsException if executing the function would cause you to exceed a concurrency limit at either the account level (ConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded) or function level (ReservedFunctionConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded). For functions with a long timeout, your client might be disconnected during synchronous invocation while it waits for a response.

Subsequent calls from the same Amazon ECS task instance (e.g. task-id) or Amazon EKS pod will not throw a CustomerNotSubscribedException, even if the customer unsubscribes while the Amazon ECS task or Amazon EKS pod is still running. Metering: RegisterUsage meters software use per ECS task, per hour, or per pod for Amazon EKS with usage prorated to the second. A minimum of 1 minute of usage applies to tasks that are short lived. For example, if a customer has a 10 node Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS cluster and a service configured as a Daemon Set, then Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS will launch a task on all 10 cluster nodes and the customer will be charged: (10 * hourly_rate). Metering for software use is automatically handled by the AWS Marketplace Metering Control Plane -- your software is not required to perform any metering specific actions, other than call RegisterUsage once for metering of software use to commence. The AWS Marketplace Metering Control Plane will also continue to bill customers for running ECS tasks and Amazon EKS pods, regardless of the customers subscription state, removing the need for your software to perform entitlement checks at runtime."},{"ref":"AWS.MarketplaceMetering.html#resolve_customer/3","title":"AWS.MarketplaceMetering.resolve_customer/3","type":"function","doc":"ResolveCustomer is called by a SaaS application during the registration process.

You can use AWS OpsWorks CM to create and manage AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate and AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise servers, and add or remove nodes for the servers to manage. Glossary of terms Server: A configuration management server that can be highly-available. The configuration management server runs on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, and may use various other AWS services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) and Elastic Load Balancing. A server is a generic abstraction over the configuration manager that you want to use, much like Amazon RDS. In AWS OpsWorks CM, you do not start or stop servers. After you create servers, they continue to run until they are deleted. Engine: The engine is the specific configuration manager that you want to use. Valid values in this release include ChefAutomate and Puppet. Backup: This is an application-level backup of the data that the configuration manager stores. AWS OpsWorks CM creates an S3 bucket for backups when you launch the first server. A backup maintains a snapshot of a server&#39;s configuration-related attributes at the time the backup starts. Events: Events are always related to a server. Events are written during server creation, when health checks run, when backups are created, when system maintenance is performed, etc. When you delete a server, the server&#39;s events are also deleted. Account attributes: Every account has attributes that are assigned in the AWS OpsWorks CM database. These attributes store information about configuration limits (servers, backups, etc.) and your customer account. Endpoints AWS OpsWorks CM supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect to one of the following endpoints. Your servers can only be accessed or managed within the endpoint in which they are created. opsworks-cm.us-east-1.amazonaws.com opsworks-cm.us-east-2.amazonaws.com opsworks-cm.us-west-1.amazonaws.com opsworks-cm.us-west-2.amazonaws.com opsworks-cm.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com opsworks-cm.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com opsworks-cm.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com opsworks-cm.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com opsworks-cm.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com For more information, see AWS OpsWorks endpoints and quotas in the AWS General Reference.

This guide provides information about the Amazon Pinpoint Email API (version 1.0), including supported operations, data types, parameters, and schemas. Amazon Pinpoint is an AWS service that you can use to engage with your customers across multiple messaging channels. You can use Amazon Pinpoint to send email, SMS text messages, voice messages, and push notifications. The Amazon Pinpoint Email API provides programmatic access to options that are unique to the email channel and supplement the options provided by the Amazon Pinpoint API. If you&#39;re new to Amazon Pinpoint, you might find it helpful to also review the Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide. The Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide provides tutorials, code samples, and procedures that demonstrate how to use Amazon Pinpoint features programmatically and how to integrate Amazon Pinpoint functionality into mobile apps and other types of applications. The guide also provides information about key topics such as Amazon Pinpoint integration with other AWS services and the limits that apply to using the service. The Amazon Pinpoint Email API is available in several AWS Regions and it provides an endpoint for each of these Regions. For a list of all the Regions and endpoints where the API is currently available, see AWS Service Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. To learn more about AWS Regions, see Managing AWS Regions in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These Availability Zones are physically isolated from each other, but are united by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These Availability Zones enable us to provide very high levels of availability and redundancy, while also minimizing latency. To learn more about the number of Availability Zones that are available in each Region, see AWS Global Infrastructure."},{"ref":"AWS.PinpointEmail.html#create_configuration_set/3","title":"AWS.PinpointEmail.create_configuration_set/3","type":"function","doc":"Create a configuration set.

The QuickSight console evaluates which customizations to apply by running this API operation with the Resolved flag included. To determine what customizations display when you run this command, it can help to visualize the relationship of the entities involved. AWS Account - The AWS account exists at the top of the hierarchy. It has the potential to use all of the AWS Regions and AWS Services. When you subscribe to QuickSight, you choose one AWS Region to use as your home Region. That&#39;s where your free SPICE capacity is located. You can use QuickSight in any supported AWS Region. AWS Region - In each AWS Region where you sign in to QuickSight at least once, QuickSight acts as a separate instance of the same service. If you have a user directory, it resides in us-east-1, which is the US East (N. Virginia). Generally speaking, these users have access to QuickSight in any AWS Region, unless they are constrained to a namespace. To run the command in a different AWS Region, you change your Region settings. If you&#39;re using the AWS CLI, you can use one of the following options: * Use [command line options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-options.html). * Use [named profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html). * Run `aws configure` to change your default AWS Region. Use Enter to key the same settings for your keys. For more information, see Configuring the AWS CLI. Namespace - A QuickSight namespace is a partition that contains users and assets (data sources, datasets, dashboards, and so on). To access assets that are in a specific namespace, users and groups must also be part of the same namespace. People who share a namespace are completely isolated from users and assets in other namespaces, even if they are in the same AWS account and AWS Region. Applied customizations - Within an AWS Region, a set of QuickSight customizations can apply to an AWS account or to a namespace. Settings that you apply to a namespace override settings that you apply to an AWS account. All settings are isolated to a single AWS Region. To apply them in other AWS Regions, run the CreateAccountCustomization command in each AWS Region where you want to apply the same customizations."},{"ref":"AWS.QuickSight.html#describe_account_settings/3","title":"AWS.QuickSight.describe_account_settings/3","type":"function","doc":"Describes the settings that were used when your QuickSight subscription was first created in this AWS account."},{"ref":"AWS.QuickSight.html#describe_analysis/4","title":"AWS.QuickSight.describe_analysis/4","type":"function","doc":"Provides a summary of the metadata for an analysis."},{"ref":"AWS.QuickSight.html#describe_analysis_permissions/4","title":"AWS.QuickSight.describe_analysis_permissions/4","type":"function","doc":"Provides the read and write permissions for an analysis."},{"ref":"AWS.QuickSight.html#describe_dashboard/6","title":"AWS.QuickSight.describe_dashboard/6","type":"function","doc":"Provides a summary for a dashboard."},{"ref":"AWS.QuickSight.html#describe_dashboard_permissions/4","title":"AWS.QuickSight.describe_dashboard_permissions/4","type":"function","doc":"Describes read and write permissions for a dashboard."},{"ref":"AWS.QuickSight.html#describe_data_set/4","title":"AWS.QuickSight.describe_data_set/4","type":"function","doc":"Describes a dataset."},{"ref":"AWS.QuickSight.html#describe_data_set_permissions/4","title":"AWS.QuickSight.describe_data_set_permissions/4","type":"function","doc":"Describes the permissions on a dataset.

It provides cost-efficient, resizeable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their applications and businesses unique. Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or Amazon Aurora database server. These capabilities mean that the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your database and maintains the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your DB instance&#39;s compute resources and storage capacity to meet your application&#39;s demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you use. This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics from the user guide. Amazon RDS API Reference For the alphabetical list of API actions, see API Actions. For the alphabetical list of data types, see Data Types. For a list of common query parameters, see Common Parameters. For descriptions of the error codes, see Common Errors.

To copy a DB cluster snapshot from a shared manual DB cluster snapshot, SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the shared DB cluster snapshot. You can copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another AWS Region. In that case, the AWS Region where you call the CopyDBClusterSnapshot action is the destination AWS Region for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied to. To copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another AWS Region, you must provide the following values: KmsKeyId - The AWS Key Management System (AWS KMS) key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination AWS Region. PreSignedUrl - A URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the CopyDBClusterSnapshot action to be called in the source AWS Region where the DB cluster snapshot is copied from. The pre-signed URL must be a valid request for the CopyDBClusterSnapshot API action that can be executed in the source AWS Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. The pre-signed URL request must contain the following parameter values: * `KmsKeyId` - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination AWS Region. This is the same identifier for both the CopyDBClusterSnapshot action that is called in the destination AWS Region, and the action contained in the pre-signed URL. * `DestinationRegion` - The name of the AWS Region that the DB cluster snapshot is to be created in. * `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source AWS Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 AWS Region, then your SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier looks like the following example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:aurora-cluster1-snapshot-20161115. To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (AWS Signature Version 4) and Signature Version 4 Signing Process. If you are using an AWS SDK tool or the AWS CLI, you can specify SourceRegion (or --source-region for the AWS CLI) instead of specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying SourceRegion autogenerates a pre-signed URL that is a valid request for the operation that can be executed in the source AWS Region. TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier - The identifier for the new copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination AWS Region. SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the ARN format for the source AWS Region and is the same value as the SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier in the pre-signed URL. To cancel the copy operation once it is in progress, delete the target DB cluster snapshot identified by TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier while that DB cluster snapshot is in &quot;copying&quot; status.

For a summary of the Amazon Redshift cluster management interfaces, go to Using the Amazon Redshift Management Interfaces. Amazon Redshift manages all the work of setting up, operating, and scaling a data warehouse: provisioning capacity, monitoring and backing up the cluster, and applying patches and upgrades to the Amazon Redshift engine.

If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn&#39;t supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file. In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, role, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match. By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the SimilarityThreshold parameter. CompareFaces also returns an array of faces that don&#39;t match the source image. For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box of the face and confidence value. The QualityFilter input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Use QualityFilter to set the quality bar by specifying LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify NONE. The default value is NONE.

If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file. For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels. Each label provides the object name, and the level of confidence that the image contains the object.

The response includes all three labels, one for each object. {Name: lighthouse, Confidence: 98.4629} {Name: rock,Confidence: 79.2097} {Name: sea,Confidence: 75.061} In the preceding example, the operation returns one label for each of the three objects. The operation can also return multiple labels for the same object in the image. For example, if the input image shows a flower (for example, a tulip), the operation might return the following three labels. {Name: flower,Confidence: 99.0562} {Name: plant,Confidence: 99.0562} {Name: tulip,Confidence: 99.0562} In this example, the detection algorithm more precisely identifies the flower as a tulip.

Use QualityFilter, to set the quality bar by specifying LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify NONE. To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of the face model or higher. To get the version of the face model associated with a collection, call DescribeCollection. Information about faces detected in an image, but not indexed, is returned in an array of UnindexedFace objects, UnindexedFaces. Faces aren&#39;t indexed for reasons such as: The number of faces detected exceeds the value of the MaxFaces request parameter. The face is too small compared to the image dimensions. The face is too blurry. The image is too dark. The face has an extreme pose. The face doesn’t have enough detail to be suitable for face search. In response, the IndexFaces operation returns an array of metadata for all detected faces, FaceRecords. This includes: The bounding box, BoundingBox, of the detected face. A confidence value, Confidence, which indicates the confidence that the bounding box contains a face. A face ID, FaceId, assigned by the service for each face that&#39;s detected and stored. An image ID, ImageId, assigned by the service for the input image. If you request all facial attributes (by using the detectionAttributes parameter), Amazon Rekognition returns detailed facial attributes, such as facial landmarks (for example, location of eye and mouth) and other facial attributes. If you provide the same image, specify the same collection, and use the same external ID in the IndexFaces operation, Amazon Rekognition doesn&#39;t save duplicate face metadata. The input image is passed either as base64-encoded image bytes, or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn&#39;t supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.

Do not store personally identifiable information (PII) or other confidential or sensitive information in tags. We use tags to provide you with billing and administration services. Tags are not intended to be used for private or sensitive data. Tagging can help you organize your resources and enables you to simplify resource management, access management and cost allocation. You can use the resource groups tagging API operations to complete the following tasks: Tag and untag supported resources located in the specified Region for the AWS account. Use tag-based filters to search for resources located in the specified Region for the AWS account. List all existing tag keys in the specified Region for the AWS account. List all existing values for the specified key in the specified Region for the AWS account. To use resource groups tagging API operations, you must add the following permissions to your IAM policy: tag:GetResources tag:TagResources tag:UntagResources tag:GetTagKeys tag:GetTagValues You&#39;ll also need permissions to access the resources of individual services so that you can tag and untag those resources.

For example, you can use ChangeResourceRecordSets to create a resource record set that routes traffic for test.example.com to a web server that has an IP address of 192.0.2.44. Deleting Resource Record Sets To delete a resource record set, you must specify all the same values that you specified when you created it. Change Batches and Transactional Changes The request body must include a document with a ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest element. The request body contains a list of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered transactional changes. Route 53 validates the changes in the request and then either makes all or none of the changes in the change batch request. This ensures that DNS routing isn&#39;t adversely affected by partial changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone. For example, suppose a change batch request contains two changes: it deletes the CNAME resource record set for www.example.com and creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. If validation for both records succeeds, Route 53 deletes the first resource record set and creates the second resource record set in a single operation. If validation for either the DELETE or the CREATE action fails, then the request is canceled, and the original CNAME record continues to exist. If you try to delete the same resource record set more than once in a single change batch, Route 53 returns an InvalidChangeBatch error. Traffic Flow To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use either the traffic flow visual editor in the Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a traffic policy, then associate the traffic policy with one or more domain names (such as example.com) or subdomain names (such as www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back the updates if the new configuration isn&#39;t performing as expected. For more information, see Using Traffic Flow to Route DNS Traffic in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. Create, Delete, and Upsert Use ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest to perform the following actions: CREATE: Creates a resource record set that has the specified values. DELETE: Deletes an existing resource record set that has the specified values. UPSERT: If a resource record set does not already exist, AWS creates it. If a resource set does exist, Route 53 updates it with the values in the request. Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and Deleting Resource Record Sets The syntax for a request depends on the type of resource record set that you want to create, delete, or update, such as weighted, alias, or failover. The XML elements in your request must appear in the order listed in the syntax. For an example for each type of resource record set, see &quot;Examples.&quot; Don&#39;t refer to the syntax in the &quot;Parameter Syntax&quot; section, which includes all of the elements for every kind of resource record set that you can create, delete, or update by using ChangeResourceRecordSets. Change Propagation to Route 53 DNS Servers When you submit a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, Route 53 propagates your changes to all of the Route 53 authoritative DNS servers. While your changes are propagating, GetChange returns a status of PENDING. When propagation is complete, GetChange returns a status of INSYNC. Changes generally propagate to all Route 53 name servers within 60 seconds. For more information, see GetChange.

ELB Load Balancers If you&#39;re registering EC2 instances with an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancer, do not create Amazon Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances. When you register an EC2 instance with a load balancer, you configure settings for an ELB health check, which performs a similar function to a Route 53 health check. Private Hosted Zones You can associate health checks with failover resource record sets in a private hosted zone. Note the following: Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the health of an endpoint within a VPC by IP address, you must assign a public IP address to the instance in the VPC. You can configure a health checker to check the health of an external resource that the instance relies on, such as a database server. You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatch metric that checks the status of the Amazon EC2 StatusCheckFailed metric, add an alarm to the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm.

For more information about charges for hosted zones, see Amazon Route 53 Pricing. Note the following: You can&#39;t create a hosted zone for a top-level domain (TLD) such as .com. For public hosted zones, Route 53 automatically creates a default SOA record and four NS records for the zone. For more information about SOA and NS records, see NS and SOA Records that Route 53 Creates for a Hosted Zone in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. If you want to use the same name servers for multiple public hosted zones, you can optionally associate a reusable delegation set with the hosted zone. See the DelegationSetId element.

For more information, see Migrating DNS Service for an Existing Domain to Amazon Route 53 in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

After you create a query logging configuration, Amazon Route 53 begins to publish log data to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group.

If you create a query logging configuration using the Route 53 console, Route 53 performs these operations automatically. Create a CloudWatch Logs log group, and make note of the ARN, which you specify when you create a query logging configuration. Note the following: You must create the log group in the us-east-1 region. You must use the same AWS account to create the log group and the hosted zone that you want to configure query logging for. When you create log groups for query logging, we recommend that you use a consistent prefix, for example: /aws/route53/*hosted zone name* In the next step, you&#39;ll create a resource policy, which controls access to one or more log groups and the associated AWS resources, such as Route 53 hosted zones. There&#39;s a limit on the number of resource policies that you can create, so we recommend that you use a consistent prefix so you can use the same resource policy for all the log groups that you create for query logging. Create a CloudWatch Logs resource policy, and give it the permissions that Route 53 needs to create log streams and to send query logs to log streams. For the value of Resource, specify the ARN for the log group that you created in the previous step. To use the same resource policy for all the CloudWatch Logs log groups that you created for query logging configurations, replace the hosted zone name with *, for example: arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/* You can&#39;t use the CloudWatch console to create or edit a resource policy. You must use the CloudWatch API, one of the AWS SDKs, or the AWS CLI. Log Streams and Edge Locations When Route 53 finishes creating the configuration for DNS query logging, it does the following: Creates a log stream for an edge location the first time that the edge location responds to DNS queries for the specified hosted zone. That log stream is used to log all queries that Route 53 responds to for that edge location. Begins to send query logs to the applicable log stream. The name of each log stream is in the following format: *hosted zone ID*/*edge location code* The edge location code is a three-letter code and an arbitrarily assigned number, for example, DFW3. The three-letter code typically corresponds with the International Air Transport Association airport code for an airport near the edge location. (These abbreviations might change in the future.) For a list of edge locations, see &quot;The Route 53 Global Network&quot; on the Route 53 Product Details page. Queries That Are Logged Query logs contain only the queries that DNS resolvers forward to Route 53. If a DNS resolver has already cached the response to a query (such as the IP address for a load balancer for example.com), the resolver will continue to return the cached response. It doesn&#39;t forward another query to Route 53 until the TTL for the corresponding resource record set expires. Depending on how many DNS queries are submitted for a resource record set, and depending on the TTL for that resource record set, query logs might contain information about only one query out of every several thousand queries that are submitted to DNS. For more information about how DNS works, see Routing Internet Traffic to Your Website or Web Application in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. Log File Format For a list of the values in each query log and the format of each value, see Logging DNS Queries in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

You can&#39;t associate a reusable delegation set with a private hosted zone. For information about using a reusable delegation set to configure white label name servers, see Configuring White Label Name Servers. The process for migrating existing hosted zones to use a reusable delegation set is comparable to the process for configuring white label name servers. You need to perform the following steps: Create a reusable delegation set. Recreate hosted zones, and reduce the TTL to 60 seconds or less. Recreate resource record sets in the new hosted zones. Change the registrar&#39;s name servers to use the name servers for the new hosted zones. Monitor traffic for the website or application. Change TTLs back to their original values.

If you want to keep your domain registration but you want to stop routing internet traffic to your website or web application, we recommend that you delete resource record sets in the hosted zone instead of deleting the hosted zone. If you delete a hosted zone, you can&#39;t undelete it. You must create a new hosted zone and update the name servers for your domain registration, which can require up to 48 hours to take effect. (If you delegated responsibility for a subdomain to a hosted zone and you delete the child hosted zone, you must update the name servers in the parent hosted zone.) In addition, if you delete a hosted zone, someone could hijack the domain and route traffic to their own resources using your domain name. If you want to avoid the monthly charge for the hosted zone, you can transfer DNS service for the domain to a free DNS service. When you transfer DNS service, you have to update the name servers for the domain registration. If the domain is registered with Route 53, see UpdateDomainNameservers for information about how to replace Route 53 name servers with name servers for the new DNS service. If the domain is registered with another registrar, use the method provided by the registrar to update name servers for the domain registration. For more information, perform an internet search on &quot;free DNS service.&quot; You can delete a hosted zone only if it contains only the default SOA record and NS resource record sets. If the hosted zone contains other resource record sets, you must delete them before you can delete the hosted zone. If you try to delete a hosted zone that contains other resource record sets, the request fails, and Route 53 returns a HostedZoneNotEmpty error. For information about deleting records from your hosted zone, see ChangeResourceRecordSets. To verify that the hosted zone has been deleted, do one of the following: Use the GetHostedZone action to request information about the hosted zone. Use the ListHostedZones action to get a list of the hosted zones associated with the current AWS account."},{"ref":"AWS.Route53.html#delete_query_logging_config/4","title":"AWS.Route53.delete_query_logging_config/4","type":"function","doc":"Deletes a configuration for DNS query logging.

You can also configure DNS resolution between your VPC and your network over a Direct Connect or VPN connection: Forward DNS queries from resolvers on your network to Route 53 Resolver DNS resolvers on your network can forward DNS queries to Resolver in a specified VPC. This allows your DNS resolvers to easily resolve domain names for AWS resources such as EC2 instances or records in a Route 53 private hosted zone. For more information, see How DNS Resolvers on Your Network Forward DNS Queries to Route 53 Resolver in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. Conditionally forward queries from a VPC to resolvers on your network You can configure Resolver to forward queries that it receives from EC2 instances in your VPCs to DNS resolvers on your network. To forward selected queries, you create Resolver rules that specify the domain names for the DNS queries that you want to forward (such as example.com), and the IP addresses of the DNS resolvers on your network that you want to forward the queries to. If a query matches multiple rules (example.com, acme.example.com), Resolver chooses the rule with the most specific match (acme.example.com) and forwards the query to the IP addresses that you specified in that rule.

You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic operation using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy API. For more information, see Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API. All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have read access to the source object and write access to the destination bucket. For more information, see REST Authentication. Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account. A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy operation starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the 200 OK response. This means that a 200 OK response can contain either a success or an error. Design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object. If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If it were not, it would not contain the content-length, and you would need to read the entire body. The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that you specify for the destination object. For pricing information, see Amazon S3 pricing. Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 Bad Request error. For more information, see Transfer Acceleration. Metadata When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more information, see Using ACLs. To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source object or replaced with metadata provided in the request, you can optionally add the x-amz-metadata-directive header. When you grant permissions, you can use the s3:x-amz-metadata-directive condition key to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded. For more information, see Specifying Conditions in a Policy in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide. For a complete list of Amazon S3-specific condition keys, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3. x-amz-copy-source-if Headers To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the Etag matches or whether the object was modified before or after a specified date, use the following request parameters: x-amz-copy-source-if-match x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since If both the x-amz-copy-source-if-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and copies the data: x-amz-copy-source-if-match condition evaluates to true x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since condition evaluates to false If both the x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the 412 Precondition Failed response code: x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match condition evaluates to false x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since condition evaluates to true All headers with the x-amz- prefix, including x-amz-copy-source, must be signed. Encryption The source object that you are copying can be encrypted or unencrypted. The source object can be encrypted with server-side encryption using AWS managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) or by using a customer-provided encryption key. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. You can optionally use the appropriate encryption-related headers to request server-side encryption for the target object. You have the option to provide your own encryption key or use SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS, regardless of the form of server-side encryption that was used to encrypt the source object. You can even request encryption if the source object was not encrypted. For more information about server-side encryption, see Using Server-Side Encryption. Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers When copying an object, you can optionally use headers to grant ACL-based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview and Managing ACLs Using the REST API. Storage Class Options You can use the CopyObject operation to change the storage class of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3 using the StorageClass parameter. For more information, see Storage Classes in the Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide. Versioning By default, x-amz-copy-source identifies the current version of an object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use the versionId subresource. If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the x-amz-version-id response header in the response. If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null. If the source object&#39;s storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this object before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation. For more information, see RestoreObject.

If you want to create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see Create Bucket. By default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You can optionally specify a Region in the request body. You might choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements.

Accordingly, the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more information, see Virtual hosting of buckets. When creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the bucket. There are two ways to grant the appropriate permissions using the request headers. Specify a canned ACL using the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see Canned ACL. Specify access permissions explicitly using the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-write, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access control list (ACL) overview. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following: * `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account * `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group * `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia) US West (N. California) US West (Oregon) Asia Pacific (Singapore) Asia Pacific (Sydney) Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Europe (Ireland) South America (São Paulo) For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference. For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants the AWS accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata: x-amz-grant-read: id=&quot;11112222333&quot;, id=&quot;444455556666&quot; You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both. The following operations are related to CreateBucket: PutObject * DeleteBucket"},{"ref":"AWS.S3.html#create_multipart_upload/5","title":"AWS.S3.create_multipart_upload/5","type":"function","doc":"This operation initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see UploadPart). You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request. For more information about multipart uploads, see Multipart Upload Overview. If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the upload must complete within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort operation and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy. For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload API and Permissions. For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see Authenticating Requests (AWS Signature Version 4). After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload. You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master keys (CMKs) or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in UploadPart and UploadPartCopy requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using CreateMultipartUpload. To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an AWS KMS CMK, the requester must have permission to the kms:Encrypt, kms:Decrypt, kms:ReEncrypt*, kms:GenerateDataKey*, and kms:DescribeKey actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. If your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same AWS account as the AWS KMS CMK, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role. For more information, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption. Definitions Access Permissions When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers: Specify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. For more information, see Canned ACL. Specify access permissions explicitly with the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview. You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both. Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed encryption keys or provide your own encryption key. Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) – If you want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request. x-amz-server-side-encryption x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id x-amz-server-side-encryption-context If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms, but don&#39;t provide x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id, Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in AWS KMS to protect the data. All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don&#39;t make them with SSL or by using SigV4. For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS. Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request. x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5 For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS. Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the object. For more information, see Using ACLs. With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods: Specify a canned ACL (x-amz-acl) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see Canned ACL. Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific AWS accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview. In the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions explicitly, use: x-amz-grant-read x-amz-grant-write x-amz-grant-read-acp x-amz-grant-write-acp x-amz-grant-full-control You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following: `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia) US West (N. California) US West (Oregon) Asia Pacific (Singapore) Asia Pacific (Sydney) Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Europe (Ireland) South America (São Paulo) For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference. For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants the AWS accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata: x-amz-grant-read: id=&quot;11112222333&quot;, id=&quot;444455556666&quot; The following operations are related to CreateMultipartUpload: UploadPart * CompleteMultipartUpload AbortMultipartUpload ListParts * ListMultipartUploads"},{"ref":"AWS.S3.html#delete_bucket/4","title":"AWS.S3.delete_bucket/4","type":"function","doc":"Deletes the S3 bucket.

The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete operation and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted. The operation supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the operation uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete operation encountered an error. For a successful deletion, the operation does not return any information about the delete in the response body.

To use GET, you must have READ access to the object. If you grant READ access to the anonymous user, you can return the object without using an authorization header. An Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find in a typical computer file system. You can, however, create a logical hierarchy by using object key names that imply a folder structure. For example, instead of naming an object sample.jpg, you can name it photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key name for the object in the GET operation. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg, specify the resource as /photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. For a path-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg in the bucket named examplebucket, specify the resource as /examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. For more information about request types, see HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification. To distribute large files to many people, you can save bandwidth costs by using BitTorrent. For more information, see Amazon S3 Torrent. For more information about returning the ACL of an object, see GetObjectAcl. If the object you are retrieving is stored in the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage classes, before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using RestoreObject. Otherwise, this operation returns an InvalidObjectStateError error. For information about restoring archived objects, see Restoring Archived Objects. Encryption request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption, should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error. If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following headers: x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5 For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys). Assuming you have permission to read object tags (permission for the s3:GetObjectVersionTagging action), the response also returns the x-amz-tagging-count header that provides the count of number of tags associated with the object. You can use GetObjectTagging to retrieve the tag set associated with an object. Permissions You need the s3:GetObject permission for this operation. For more information, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy. If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission. If you have the s3:ListBucket permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 404 (&quot;no such key&quot;) error. If you don’t have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 403 (&quot;access denied&quot;) error. Versioning By default, the GET operation returns the current version of an object. To return a different version, use the versionId subresource. If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted and includes x-amz-delete-marker: true in the response. For more information about versioning, see PutBucketVersioning. Overriding Response Header Values There are times when you want to override certain response header values in a GET response. For example, you might override the Content-Disposition response header value in your GET request. You can override values for a set of response headers using the following query parameters. These response header values are sent only on a successful request, that is, when status code 200 OK is returned. The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers that you can override for the GET response are Content-Type, Content-Language, Expires, Cache-Control, Content-Disposition, and Content-Encoding. To override these header values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters. You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned URL, when using these parameters. They cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request. response-content-type response-content-language response-expires response-cache-control response-content-disposition response-content-encoding Additional Considerations about Request Headers If both of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers are present in the request as follows: If-Match condition evaluates to true, and; If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false; then, S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested. If both of the If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers are present in the request as follows:If-None-Match condition evaluates to false, and; If-Modified-Since condition evaluates to true; then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified response code.

For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach. Access Permissions You can set access permissions using one of the following methods: Specify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of x-amz-acl. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see Canned ACL. * Specify access permissions explicitly with the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the x-amz-acl header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following: * `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account * `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group * `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions: US East (N.

For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin is http://www.example.com to access your Amazon S3 bucket at my.example.bucket.com by using the browser&#39;s XMLHttpRequest capability. To enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add the cors subresource to the bucket. The cors subresource is an XML document in which you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods that can be executed on your bucket. The document is limited to 64 KB in size. When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request) against a bucket, it evaluates the cors configuration on the bucket and uses the first CORSRule rule that matches the incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be met: The request&#39;s Origin header must match AllowedOrigin elements. The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on) or the Access-Control-Request-Method header in case of a pre-flight OPTIONS request must be one of the AllowedMethod elements.

Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application layer or use versioning instead. To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the Content-MD5 header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value. The Content-MD5 header is required for any request to upload an object with a retention period configured using Amazon S3 Object Lock. For more information about Amazon S3 Object Lock, see Amazon S3 Object Lock Overview in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. Server-side Encryption You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. You have the option to provide your own encryption key or use AWS managed encryption keys. For more information, see Using Server-Side Encryption. Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers You can use headers to grant ACL- based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview and Managing ACLs Using the REST API.

Access Permissions You can set access permissions using one of the following methods: Specify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of x-amz-acl.

If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use x-amz-acl header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following: * `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account * `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group * `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions: US East (N.

This action performs the following types of requests: select - Perform a select query on an archived object restore an archive - Restore an archived object To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:RestoreObject action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. Querying Archives with Select Requests You use a select type of request to perform SQL queries on archived objects. The archived objects that are being queried by the select request must be formatted as uncompressed comma-separated values (CSV) files. You can run queries and custom analytics on your archived data without having to restore your data to a hotter Amazon S3 tier. For an overview about select requests, see Querying Archived Objects in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. When making a select request, do the following: Define an output location for the select query&#39;s output. This must be an Amazon S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the bucket that contains the archive object that is being queried. The AWS account that initiates the job must have permissions to write to the S3 bucket. You can specify the storage class and encryption for the output objects stored in the bucket. For more information about output, see Querying Archived Objects in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. For more information about the S3 structure in the request body, see the following: * PutObject Managing Access with ACLs in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* * [Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html) in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide Define the SQL expression for the SELECT type of restoration for your query in the request body&#39;s SelectParameters structure. You can use expressions like the following examples. The following expression returns all records from the specified object. SELECT * FROM Object * Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in the object, you can specify columns with positional headers. SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 &gt; 100 * If you have headers and you set the `fileHeaderInfo` in the `CSV` structure in the request body to USE, you can specify headers in the query. (If you set the fileHeaderInfo field to IGNORE, the first row is skipped for the query.) You cannot mix ordinal positions with header column names. SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN FROM S3Object s For more information about using SQL with S3 Glacier Select restore, see SQL Reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. When making a select request, you can also do the following: To expedite your queries, specify the Expedited tier. For more information about tiers, see &quot;Restoring Archives,&quot; later in this topic. Specify details about the data serialization format of both the input object that is being queried and the serialization of the CSV-encoded query results. The following are additional important facts about the select feature: The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive retrievals, they are stored until explicitly deleted-manually or through a lifecycle policy. You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object. Amazon S3 doesn&#39;t deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing duplicate requests. Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already been restored. A select request doesn’t return error response 409. Restoring Archives Objects in the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE storage classes are archived. To access an archived object, you must first initiate a restore request. This restores a temporary copy of the archived object. In a restore request, you specify the number of days that you want the restored copy to exist. After the specified period, Amazon S3 deletes the temporary copy but the object remains archived in the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class that object was restored from. To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don&#39;t provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version. The time it takes restore jobs to finish depends on which storage class the object is being restored from and which data access tier you specify. When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the Tier element of the request body: Expedited - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the GLACIER storage class when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals are typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class. Standard - S3 Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. S3 Standard retrievals typically complete within 3-5 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically complete within 12 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class. Bulk - Bulk retrievals are Amazon S3 Glacier’s lowest-cost retrieval option, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively in a day. Bulk retrievals typically complete within 5-12 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically complete within 48 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class. For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for Expedited data access, see Restoring Archived Objects in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. You upgrade the speed of an in-progress restoration by issuing another restore request to the same object, setting a new Tier request element. When issuing a request to upgrade the restore tier, you must choose a tier that is faster than the tier that the in-progress restore is using. You must not change any other parameters, such as the Days request element. For more information, see Upgrading the Speed of an In-Progress Restore in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. To get the status of object restoration, you can send a HEAD request. Operations return the x-amz-restore header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object. If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration and Object Lifecycle Management in Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. Responses A successful operation returns either the 200 OK or 202 Accepted status code. If the object copy is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns 202 Accepted in the response. If the object copy is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK in the response. Special Errors Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress Cause: Object restore is already in progress.

In this operation, you provide part data in your request. However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the UploadPartCopy operation. You must initiate a multipart upload (see CreateMultipartUpload) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your upload part request. Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload. To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the Content-MD5 header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error. If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then AWS S3 uses the x-amz-content-sha256 header as a checksum instead of Content-MD5. For more information see Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (AWS Signature Version 4). Note: After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage. For more information on multipart uploads, go to Multipart Upload Overview in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide . For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, go to Multipart Upload API and Permissions in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.

This operation is more flexible than the SendEmail API operation. When you use the SendRawEmail operation, you can specify the headers of the message as well as its content. This flexibility is useful, for example, when you want to send a multipart MIME email (such a message that contains both a text and an HTML version). You can also use this operation to send messages that include attachments. The SendRawEmail operation has the following requirements: You can only send email from verified email addresses or domains. If you try to send email from an address that isn&#39;t verified, the operation results in an &quot;Email address not verified&quot; error. If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you can only send email to other verified addresses in your account, or to addresses that are associated with the Amazon SES mailbox simulator. The maximum message size, including attachments, is 10 MB. Each message has to include at least one recipient address. A recipient address includes any address on the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines. If you send a single message to more than one recipient address, and one of the recipient addresses isn&#39;t in a valid format (that is, it&#39;s not in the format UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain), Amazon SES rejects the entire message, even if the other addresses are valid. Each message can include up to 50 recipient addresses across the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines. If you need to send a single message to more than 50 recipients, you have to split the list of recipient addresses into groups of less than 50 recipients, and send separate messages to each group. Amazon SES allows you to specify 8-bit Content-Transfer-Encoding for MIME message parts. However, if Amazon SES has to modify the contents of your message (for example, if you use open and click tracking), 8-bit content isn&#39;t preserved. For this reason, we highly recommend that you encode all content that isn&#39;t 7-bit ASCII. For more information, see MIME Encoding in the Amazon SES Developer Guide. Additionally, keep the following considerations in mind when using the SendRawEmail operation: Although you can customize the message headers when using the SendRawEmail operation, Amazon SES will automatically apply its own Message-ID and Date headers; if you passed these headers when creating the message, they will be overwritten by the values that Amazon SES provides. If you are using sending authorization to send on behalf of another user, SendRawEmail enables you to specify the cross-account identity for the email&#39;s Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one of two ways: you can pass optional parameters SourceArn, FromArn, and/or ReturnPathArn to the API, or you can include the following X-headers in the header of your raw email: X-SES-SOURCE-ARN X-SES-FROM-ARN X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN Don&#39;t include these X-headers in the DKIM signature. Amazon SES removes these before it sends the email. If you only specify the SourceIdentityArn parameter, Amazon SES sets the From and Return-Path addresses to the same identity that you specified. For more information about sending authorization, see the Using Sending Authorization with Amazon SES in the Amazon SES Developer Guide. For every message that you send, the total number of recipients (including each recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted against the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period (your sending quota).

You can use SetQueueAttributes to upload your policy. For more information, see Using Custom Policies with the Amazon SQS Access Policy Language in the Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide. An Amazon SQS policy can have a maximum of 7 actions. To remove the ability to change queue permissions, you must deny permission to the AddPermission, RemovePermission, and SetQueueAttributes actions in your IAM policy.

The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. The minimum is 0 seconds. The maximum is 12 hours. For more information, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide. For example, you have a message with a visibility timeout of 5 minutes. After 3 minutes, you call ChangeMessageVisibility with a timeout of 10 minutes. You can continue to call ChangeMessageVisibility to extend the visibility timeout to the maximum allowed time. If you try to extend the visibility timeout beyond the maximum, your request is rejected. An Amazon SQS message has three basic states: Sent to a queue by a producer. Received from the queue by a consumer. Deleted from the queue. A message is considered to be stored after it is sent to a queue by a producer, but not yet received from the queue by a consumer (that is, between states 1 and 2). There is no limit to the number of stored messages. A message is considered to be in flight after it is received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue (that is, between states 2 and 3). There is a limit to the number of inflight messages. Limits that apply to inflight messages are unrelated to the unlimited number of stored messages. For most standard queues (depending on queue traffic and message backlog), there can be a maximum of approximately 120,000 inflight messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns the OverLimit error message. To avoid reaching the limit, you should delete messages from the queue after they&#39;re processed. You can also increase the number of queues you use to process your messages. To request a limit increase, file a support request. For FIFO queues, there can be a maximum of 20,000 inflight messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns no error messages. If you attempt to set the VisibilityTimeout to a value greater than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. Amazon SQS doesn&#39;t automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum remaining time. Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a specific message the timeout value is applied immediately but isn&#39;t saved in memory for that message. If you don&#39;t delete a message after it is received, the visibility timeout for the message reverts to the original timeout value (not to the value you set using the ChangeMessageVisibility action) the next time the message is received."},{"ref":"AWS.SQS.html#change_message_visibility_batch/3","title":"AWS.SQS.change_message_visibility_batch/3","type":"function","doc":"Changes the visibility timeout of multiple messages.

You must either create a new FIFO queue for your application or delete your existing standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO queue. For more information, see Moving From a Standard Queue to a FIFO Queue in the Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide. If you don&#39;t provide a value for an attribute, the queue is created with the default value for the attribute.

These temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use AssumeRole within your account or for cross-account access. For a comparison of AssumeRole with other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see Requesting Temporary Security Credentials and Comparing the AWS STS API operations in the IAM User Guide. You cannot use AWS account root user credentials to call AssumeRole. You must use credentials for an IAM user or an IAM role to call AssumeRole. For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term credentials in each account to access those resources. However, managing all those credentials and remembering which one can access which account can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term credentials in one account. Then use temporary security credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming roles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see IAM Roles in the IAM User Guide. Session Duration By default, the temporary security credentials created by AssumeRole last for one hour. However, you can use the optional DurationSeconds parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role in the IAM User Guide. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the AssumeRole* API operations or the assume-role* CLI commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see Using IAM Roles in the IAM User Guide. Permissions The temporary security credentials created by AssumeRole can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: You cannot call the AWS STS GetFederationToken or GetSessionToken API operations. (Optional) You can pass inline or managed session policies to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies can&#39;t exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session&#39;s permissions are the intersection of the role&#39;s identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role&#39;s temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see Session Policies in the IAM User Guide. To assume a role from a different account, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role&#39;s trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account. A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that are delegated from the user account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call AssumeRole for the ARN of the role in the other account. If the user is in the same account as the role, then you can do either of the following: Attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous user in a different account). Add the user as a principal directly in the role&#39;s trust policy. In this case, the trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy. Users in the same account as the role do not need explicit permission to assume the role. For more information about trust policies and resource-based policies, see IAM Policies in the IAM User Guide. Tags (Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see Passing Session Tags in STS in the IAM User Guide. An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control in the IAM User Guide. You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during role chaining. For more information, see Chaining Roles with Session Tags in the IAM User Guide. Using MFA with AssumeRole (Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call AssumeRole. This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example. &quot;Condition&quot;: {&quot;Bool&quot;: {&quot;aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent&quot;: true}} For more information, see Configuring MFA-Protected API Access in the IAM User Guide guide. To use MFA with AssumeRole, you pass values for the SerialNumber and TokenCode parameters. The SerialNumber value identifies the user&#39;s hardware or virtual MFA device. The TokenCode is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces."},{"ref":"AWS.STS.html#assume_role_with_s_a_m_l/3","title":"AWS.STS.assume_role_with_s_a_m_l/3","type":"function","doc":"Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been authenticated via a SAML authentication response.

Calling AssumeRoleWithSAML can result in an entry in your AWS CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the value in the NameID element of the SAML assertion. We recommend that you use a NameIDType that is not associated with any personally identifiable information (PII). For example, you could instead use the persistent identifier (urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent). Tags (Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass attributes into your SAML assertion as session tags. Each session tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about session tags, see Passing Session Tags in STS in the IAM User Guide. You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plain text session tag keys can’t exceed 128 characters and the values can’t exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see IAM and STS Character Limits in the IAM User Guide. An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit.

You can use Amazon Cognito with the AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide and the AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide to uniquely identify a user. You can also supply the user with a consistent identity throughout the lifetime of an application. To learn more about Amazon Cognito, see Amazon Cognito Overview in AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide and Amazon Cognito Overview in the AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide. Calling AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity does not require the use of AWS security credentials.

Identities Before your application can call AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity, you must have an identity token from a supported identity provider and create a role that the application can assume. The role that your application assumes must trust the identity provider that is associated with the identity token. In other words, the identity provider must be specified in the role&#39;s trust policy. Calling AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity can result in an entry in your AWS CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the Subject of the provided Web Identity Token. We recommend that you avoid using any personally identifiable information (PII) in this field. For example, you could instead use a GUID or a pairwise identifier, as suggested in the OIDC specification.

As a result, this call is appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safely stored, usually in a server-based application. For a comparison of GetFederationToken with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see Requesting Temporary Security Credentials and Comparing the AWS STS API operations in the IAM User Guide. You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito or AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity. For more information, see Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider in the IAM User Guide. You can also call GetFederationToken using the security credentials of an AWS account root user, but we do not recommend it. Instead, we recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy application. Then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated users to only the actions and resources that they need to access. For more information, see IAM Best Practices in the IAM User Guide.

You cannot call any STS operations except GetCallerIdentity. You must pass an inline or managed session policy to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies can&#39;t exceed 2,048 characters. Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a policy, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions. When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user. For more information, see Session Policies in the IAM User Guide. For information about using GetFederationToken to create temporary security credentials, see GetFederationToken—Federation Through a Custom Identity Broker. You can use the credentials to access a resource that has a resource-based policy.

Credentials based on account credentials can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to 3,600 seconds (1 hour), with a default of 1 hour. Permissions The temporary security credentials created by GetSessionToken can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exceptions: You cannot call any IAM API operations unless MFA authentication information is included in the request. You cannot call any STS API except AssumeRole or GetCallerIdentity. We recommend that you do not call GetSessionToken with AWS account root user credentials. Instead, follow our best practices by creating one or more IAM users, giving them the necessary permissions, and using IAM users for everyday interaction with AWS. The credentials that are returned by GetSessionToken are based on permissions associated with the user whose credentials were used to call the operation. If GetSessionToken is called using AWS account root user credentials, the temporary credentials have root user permissions. Similarly, if GetSessionToken is called using the credentials of an IAM user, the temporary credentials have the same permissions as the IAM user. For more information about using GetSessionToken to create temporary credentials, go to Temporary Credentials for Users in Untrusted Environments in the IAM User Guide."},{"ref":"AWS.SWF.html","title":"AWS.SWF","type":"module","doc":"Amazon Simple Workflow Service The Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build applications that use Amazon&#39;s cloud to coordinate work across distributed components.

This guide provides descriptions of the Secrets Manager API. For more information about using this service, see the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide. API Version This version of the Secrets Manager API Reference documents the Secrets Manager API version 2017-10-17. As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms such as Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, and Android. The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS Secrets Manager. For example, the SDKs provide cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including downloading and installing them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services. We recommend you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to Secrets Manager. However, you also can use the Secrets Manager HTTP Query API to make direct calls to the Secrets Manager web service. To learn more about the Secrets Manager HTTP Query API, see Making Query Requests in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide. Secrets Manager API supports GET and POST requests for all actions, and doesn&#39;t require you to use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that require larger sizes, use a POST request. Support and Feedback for AWS Secrets Manager We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com, or post your feedback and questions in the AWS Secrets Manager Discussion Forum. For more information about the AWS Discussion Forums, see Forums Help. How examples are presented The JSON that AWS Secrets Manager expects as your request parameters and the service returns as a response to HTTP query requests contain single, long strings without line breaks or white space formatting. The JSON shown in the examples displays the code formatted with both line breaks and white space to improve readability. When example input parameters can also cause long strings extending beyond the screen, you can insert line breaks to enhance readability. You should always submit the input as a single JSON text string. Logging API Requests AWS Secrets Manager supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information that&#39;s collected by AWS CloudTrail, you can determine the requests successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about AWS Secrets Manager and support for AWS CloudTrail, see Logging AWS Secrets Manager Events with AWS CloudTrail in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.

Secrets Manager stores the encrypted secret data in one of a collection of &quot;versions&quot; associated with the secret. Each version contains a copy of the encrypted secret data. Each version is associated with one or more &quot;staging labels&quot; that identify where the version is in the rotation cycle. The SecretVersionsToStages field of the secret contains the mapping of staging labels to the active versions of the secret. Versions without a staging label are considered deprecated and not included in the list. You provide the secret data to be encrypted by putting text in either the SecretString parameter or binary data in the SecretBinary parameter, but not both. If you include SecretString or SecretBinary then Secrets Manager also creates an initial secret version and automatically attaches the staging label AWSCURRENT to the new version. If you call an operation to encrypt or decrypt the SecretString or SecretBinary for a secret in the same account as the calling user and that secret doesn&#39;t specify a AWS KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the account&#39;s default AWS managed customer master key (CMK) with the alias aws/secretsmanager. If this key doesn&#39;t already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the same AWS account automatically have access to use the default CMK. Note that if an Secrets Manager API call results in AWS creating the account&#39;s AWS-managed CMK, it can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result. If the secret resides in a different AWS account from the credentials calling an API that requires encryption or decryption of the secret value then you must create and use a custom AWS KMS CMK because you can&#39;t access the default CMK for the account using credentials from a different AWS account. Store the ARN of the CMK in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by including it in the KMSKeyId. If you call an API that must encrypt or decrypt SecretString or SecretBinary using credentials from a different account then the AWS KMS key policy must grant cross-account access to that other account&#39;s user or role for both the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt operations.

For more information about serverless applications, see Serverless Computing and Applications on the AWS website. The AWS Serverless Application Repository is deeply integrated with the AWS Lambda console, so that developers of all levels can get started with serverless computing without needing to learn anything new. You can use category keywords to browse for applications such as web and mobile backends, data processing applications, or chatbots. You can also search for applications by name, publisher, or event source. To use an application, you simply choose it, configure any required fields, and deploy it with a few clicks. You can also easily publish applications, sharing them publicly with the community at large, or privately within your team or across your organization. To publish a serverless application (or app), you can use the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or AWS SDKs to upload the code. Along with the code, you upload a simple manifest file, also known as the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template. For more information about AWS SAM, see AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) on the AWS Labs GitHub repository. The AWS Serverless Application Repository Developer Guide contains more information about the two developer experiences available: * Consuming Applications – Browse for applications and view information about them, including source code and readme files.

The service enables you to securely upload data to the AWS Cloud for cost effective backup and rapid disaster recovery. Use the following links to get started using the AWS Storage Gateway Service API Reference: AWS Storage Gateway required request headers: Describes the required headers that you must send with every POST request to AWS Storage Gateway. Signing requests: AWS Storage Gateway requires that you authenticate every request you send; this topic describes how sign such a request. Error responses: Provides reference information about AWS Storage Gateway errors. Operations in AWS Storage Gateway: Contains detailed descriptions of all AWS Storage Gateway operations, their request parameters, response elements, possible errors, and examples of requests and responses. AWS Storage Gateway endpoints and quotas: Provides a list of each AWS Region and the endpoints available for use with AWS Storage Gateway. AWS Storage Gateway resource IDs are in uppercase. When you use these resource IDs with the Amazon EC2 API, EC2 expects resource IDs in lowercase. You must change your resource ID to lowercase to use it with the EC2 API. For example, in Storage Gateway the ID for a volume might be vol-AA22BB012345DAF670. When you use this ID with the EC2 API, you must change it to vol-aa22bb012345daf670. Otherwise, the EC2 API might not behave as expected. IDs for Storage Gateway volumes and Amazon EBS snapshots created from gateway volumes are changing to a longer format. Starting in December 2016, all new volumes and snapshots will be created with a 17-character string. Starting in April 2016, you will be able to use these longer IDs so you can test your systems with the new format. For more information, see Longer EC2 and EBS resource IDs. For example, a volume Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with the longer volume ID format looks like the following: arn:aws:storagegateway:us-west-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/volume/vol-1122AABBCCDDEEFFG.

With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use. Creates a RateBasedRule. The RateBasedRule contains a RateLimit, which specifies the maximum number of requests that AWS WAF allows from a specified IP address in a five-minute period. The RateBasedRule also contains the IPSet objects, ByteMatchSet objects, and other predicates that identify the requests that you want to count or block if these requests exceed the RateLimit. If you add more than one predicate to a RateBasedRule, a request not only must exceed the RateLimit, but it also must match all the conditions to be counted or blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a RateBasedRule: An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44/32 A ByteMatchSet that matches BadBot in the User-Agent header Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000. You then add the RateBasedRule to a WebACL and specify that you want to block requests that meet the conditions in the rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 and the User-Agent header in the request must contain the value BadBot. Further, requests that match these two conditions must be received at a rate of more than 1,000 requests every five minutes. If both conditions are met and the rate is exceeded, AWS WAF blocks the requests. If the rate drops below 1,000 for a five-minute period, AWS WAF no longer blocks the requests. As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular page on your site. To do this, you could add the following to a RateBasedRule: A ByteMatchSet with FieldToMatch of URI A PositionalConstraint of STARTS_WITH A TargetString of login Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000. By adding this RateBasedRule to a WebACL, you could limit requests to your login page without affecting the rest of your site. To create and configure a RateBasedRule, perform the following steps: Create and update the predicates that you want to include in the rule.

With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use. Creates a RateBasedRule. The RateBasedRule contains a RateLimit, which specifies the maximum number of requests that AWS WAF allows from a specified IP address in a five-minute period. The RateBasedRule also contains the IPSet objects, ByteMatchSet objects, and other predicates that identify the requests that you want to count or block if these requests exceed the RateLimit. If you add more than one predicate to a RateBasedRule, a request not only must exceed the RateLimit, but it also must match all the conditions to be counted or blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a RateBasedRule: An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44/32 A ByteMatchSet that matches BadBot in the User-Agent header Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000. You then add the RateBasedRule to a WebACL and specify that you want to block requests that meet the conditions in the rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 and the User-Agent header in the request must contain the value BadBot. Further, requests that match these two conditions must be received at a rate of more than 1,000 requests every five minutes. If both conditions are met and the rate is exceeded, AWS WAF blocks the requests. If the rate drops below 1,000 for a five-minute period, AWS WAF no longer blocks the requests. As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular page on your site. To do this, you could add the following to a RateBasedRule: A ByteMatchSet with FieldToMatch of URI A PositionalConstraint of STARTS_WITH A TargetString of login Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000. By adding this RateBasedRule to a WebACL, you could limit requests to your login page without affecting the rest of your site.

The names of the entities that you use to access this API, like endpoints and namespaces, all have the versioning information added, like &quot;V2&quot; or &quot;v2&quot;, to distinguish from the prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to this version, because it has a number of significant improvements. If you used AWS WAF prior to this release, you can&#39;t use this AWS WAFV2 API to access any AWS WAF resources that you created before. You can access your old rules, web ACLs, and other AWS WAF resources only through the AWS WAF Classic APIs. The AWS WAF Classic APIs have retained the prior names, endpoints, and namespaces. For information, including how to migrate your AWS WAF resources to this version, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide. AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to Amazon CloudFront, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer, or an AWS AppSync GraphQL API. AWS WAF also lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, the API Gateway REST API, CloudFront distribution, the Application Load Balancer, or the AWS AppSync GraphQL API responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You also can configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked. This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about AWS WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about AWS WAF features and an overview of how to use AWS WAF, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide. You can make calls using the endpoints listed in AWS Service Endpoints for AWS WAF. For regional applications, you can use any of the endpoints in the list. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an API Gateway REST API, or an AppSync GraphQL API. For AWS CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint listed for US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that&#39;s tailored to the programming language or platform that you&#39;re using. For more information, see AWS SDKs. We currently provide two versions of the AWS WAF API: this API and the prior versions, the classic AWS WAF APIs. This new API provides the same functionality as the older versions, with the following major improvements: You use one API for both global and regional applications. Where you need to distinguish the scope, you specify a Scope parameter and set it to CLOUDFRONT or REGIONAL. You can define a Web ACL or rule group with a single call, and update it with a single call. You define all rule specifications in JSON format, and pass them to your rule group or Web ACL calls. The limits AWS WAF places on the use of rules more closely reflects the cost of running each type of rule.

Users can insert files into a user directory structure, as well as allow for basic metadata changes, such as modifications to the permissions of files. Security: Support security applications are supported for users who have additional security needs, such as antivirus or data loss prevention. The API actions, along with AWS CloudTrail, allow these applications to detect when changes occur in Amazon WorkDocs. Then, the application can take the necessary actions and replace the target file. If the target file violates the policy, the application can also choose to email the user. eDiscovery/Analytics: General administrative applications are supported, such as eDiscovery and analytics. These applications can choose to mimic or record the actions in an Amazon WorkDocs site, along with AWS CloudTrail, to replicate data for eDiscovery, backup, or analytical applications. All Amazon WorkDocs API actions are Amazon authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only require the use of the AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of IAM users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission policies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the Amazon WorkDocs site, the IAM user gains full administrative visibility into the entire Amazon WorkDocs site (or as set in the IAM policy).

Required Segment Document Fields name - The name of the service that handled the request. id - A 64-bit identifier for the segment, unique among segments in the same trace, in 16 hexadecimal digits. trace_id - A unique identifier that connects all segments and subsegments originating from a single client request. start_time - Time the segment or subsegment was created, in floating point seconds in epoch time, accurate to milliseconds. For example, 1480615200.010 or 1.480615200010E9. end_time - Time the segment or subsegment was closed. For example, 1480615200.090 or 1.480615200090E9.

Send an in progress segment when your application receives a request that will take a long time to serve, to trace the fact that the request was received. When the response is sent, send the complete segment to overwrite the in-progress segment. A trace_id consists of three numbers separated by hyphens. For example, 1-58406520-a006649127e371903a2de979.
