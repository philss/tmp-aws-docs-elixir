<p>Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) is a storage solution for &quot;cold data.&quot;</p>
<p>Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure, durable,
and easy-to-use storage for data backup and archival.</p>
<p>With Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months, years,
or decades. Glacier also enables customers to offload the administrative burdens
of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so they don&#39;t have to worry about
capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data replication, hardware failure and
recovery, or time-consuming hardware migrations.</p>
<p>Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is paramount and your
data is rarely retrieved. If your application requires fast or frequent access
to your data, consider using Amazon S3. For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a>.</p>
<p>You can store any kind of data in any format. There is no maximum limit on the
total amount of data you can store in Glacier.</p>
<p>If you are a first-time user of Glacier, we recommend that you begin by reading
the following sections in the <em>Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html">What is Amazon S3 Glacier</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>This section of the Developer Guide describes the underlying data model, the
operations it supports, and the AWS SDKs that you can use to interact with the
service.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-getting-started.html">Getting Started with Amazon S3 Glacier</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The Getting Started section walks you through the process of creating a vault,
uploading archives, creating jobs to download archives, retrieving the job
output, and deleting archives.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>After assembling and saving the archive to the vault, Glacier returns the URI
path of the newly created archive resource. Using the URI path, you can then
access the archive. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID
returned to retrieve the archive at a later point. You can also get the vault
inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see

<p>In the request, you must include the computed SHA256 tree hash of the entire
archive you have uploaded. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash,
see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html">Computing Checksums</a>.
On the server side, Glacier also constructs the SHA256 tree hash of the
assembled archive. If the values match, Glacier saves the archive to the vault;
otherwise, it returns an error, and the operation fails. The <code class="inline">ListParts</code>
operation returns a list of parts uploaded for a specific multipart upload. It
includes checksum information for each uploaded part that can be used to debug a
bad checksum issue.</p>
<p>Additionally, Glacier also checks for any missing content ranges when assembling
the archive, if missing content ranges are found, Glacier returns an error and
the operation fails.</p>
<p>Complete Multipart Upload is an idempotent operation. After your first
successful complete multipart upload, if you call the operation again within a
short period, the operation will succeed and return the same archive ID. This is
useful in the event you experience a network issue that causes an aborted
connection or receive a 500 server error, in which case you can repeat your
Complete Multipart Upload request and get the same archive ID without creating
duplicate archives. Note, however, that after the multipart upload completes,
you cannot call the List Parts operation and the multipart upload will not
appear in List Multipart Uploads response, even if idempotent complete is
possible.</p>
<p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However,
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don&#39;t have any permissions by
default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.

  <section class="docstring">
<p>This operation initiates a multipart upload.</p>
<p>Amazon S3 Glacier creates a multipart upload resource and returns its ID in the
response. The multipart upload ID is used in subsequent requests to upload parts
of an archive (see <code class="inline">UploadMultipartPart</code>).</p>
<p>When you initiate a multipart upload, you specify the part size in number of
bytes. The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied by a power of 2-for
example, 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304 (4 MB), 8388608 (8 MB), and so
on. The minimum allowable part size is 1 MB, and the maximum is 4 GB.</p>
<p>Every part you upload to this resource (see <code class="inline">UploadMultipartPart</code>), except the
last one, must have the same size. The last one can be the same size or smaller.
For example, suppose you want to upload a 16.2 MB file. If you initiate the
multipart upload with a part size of 4 MB, you will upload four parts of 4 MB
each and one part of 0.2 MB.</p>
<p>You don&#39;t need to know the size of the archive when you start a multipart upload
because Amazon S3 Glacier does not require you to specify the overall archive
size.</p>
<p>After you complete the multipart upload, Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) removes the
multipart upload resource referenced by the ID. Glacier also removes the
multipart upload resource if you cancel the multipart upload or it may be
removed if there is no activity for a period of 24 hours.</p>
<p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However,
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don&#39;t have any permissions by
default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.

<p>You can set one vault lock policy for each vault and this policy can be up to 20

<p>You must complete the vault locking process within 24 hours after the vault lock
enters the <code class="inline">InProgress</code> state. After the 24 hour window ends, the lock ID
expires, the vault automatically exits the <code class="inline">InProgress</code> state, and the vault
lock policy is removed from the vault. You call <code class="inline">CompleteVaultLock</code> to complete
the vault locking process by setting the state of the vault lock to <code class="inline">Locked</code>.</p>
<p>After a vault lock is in the <code class="inline">Locked</code> state, you cannot initiate a new vault

<p>This operation lists jobs for a vault, including jobs that are in-progress and
jobs that have recently finished.</p>
<p>The List Job operation returns a list of these jobs sorted by job initiation
time.</p>
<p>Amazon Glacier retains recently completed jobs for a period before deleting
them; however, it eventually removes completed jobs. The output of completed
jobs can be retrieved. Retaining completed jobs for a period of time after they
have completed enables you to get a job output in the event you miss the job
completion notification or your first attempt to download it fails. For example,
suppose you start an archive retrieval job to download an archive. After the job
completes, you start to download the archive but encounter a network error. In
this scenario, you can retry and download the archive while the job exists.</p>
<p>The List Jobs operation supports pagination. You should always check the
response <code class="inline">Marker</code> field. If there are no more jobs to list, the <code class="inline">Marker</code> field
is set to <code class="inline">null</code>. If there are more jobs to list, the <code class="inline">Marker</code> field is set to a
non-null value, which you can use to continue the pagination of the list. To
return a list of jobs that begins at a specific job, set the marker request
parameter to the <code class="inline">Marker</code> value for that job that you obtained from a previous
List Jobs request.</p>
<p>You can set a maximum limit for the number of jobs returned in the response by
specifying the <code class="inline">limit</code> parameter in the request. The default limit is 50. The
number of jobs returned might be fewer than the limit, but the number of
returned jobs never exceeds the limit.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can filter the jobs list returned by specifying the optional
<code class="inline">statuscode</code> parameter or <code class="inline">completed</code> parameter, or both. Using the <code class="inline">statuscode</code>
parameter, you can specify to return only jobs that match either the
<code class="inline">InProgress</code>, <code class="inline">Succeeded</code>, or <code class="inline">Failed</code> status. Using the <code class="inline">completed</code> parameter,
you can specify to return only jobs that were completed (<code class="inline">true</code>) or jobs that
were not completed (<code class="inline">false</code>).</p>

The list returned in the List Multipart Upload response has no guaranteed order.</p>
<p>The List Multipart Uploads operation supports pagination. By default, this

<p>Note the difference between this operation and listing parts (<code class="inline">ListParts</code>). The

<p>This operation adds an archive to a vault.</p>
<p>This is a synchronous operation, and for a successful upload, your data is
durably persisted. Amazon S3 Glacier returns the archive ID in the
<code class="inline">x-amz-archive-id</code> header of the response.</p>
<p>You must use the archive ID to access your data in Amazon S3 Glacier. After you
upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned so that you can
retrieve or delete the archive later. Besides saving the archive ID, you can
also index it and give it a friendly name to allow for better searching. You can
also use the optional archive description field to specify how the archive is
referred to in an external index of archives, such as you might create in Amazon
DynamoDB. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs
in a vault. For more information, see <code class="inline">InitiateJob</code>.</p>
<p>You must provide a SHA256 tree hash of the data you are uploading. For
information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html">Computing Checksums</a>.</p>
<p>You can optionally specify an archive description of up to 1,024 printable ASCII
characters. You can get the archive description when you either retrieve the
archive or get the vault inventory. For more information, see <code class="inline">InitiateJob</code>.
Amazon Glacier does not interpret the description in any way. An archive
description does not need to be unique. You cannot use the description to
retrieve or sort the archive list.</p>
<p>Archives are immutable. After you upload an archive, you cannot edit the archive
or its description.</p>

<p>This operation uploads a part of an archive.</p>
<p>You can upload archive parts in any order. You can also upload them in parallel.
You can upload up to 10,000 parts for a multipart upload.</p>
<p>Amazon Glacier rejects your upload part request if any of the following
conditions is true:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>SHA256 tree hash does not match</strong>To ensure that part data is not
corrupted in transmission, you compute a SHA256 tree hash of the part and
include it in your request. Upon receiving the part data, Amazon S3 Glacier also
computes a SHA256 tree hash. If these hash values don&#39;t match, the operation
fails. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html">Computing Checksums</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Part size does not match</strong>The size of each part except the last
must match the size specified in the corresponding <code class="inline">InitiateMultipartUpload</code>
request. The size of the last part must be the same size as, or smaller than,
the specified size.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part size you specified in
your initiate multipart upload request and that part is not the last part, then
the upload part request will succeed. However, the subsequent Complete Multipart
Upload request will fail.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Range does not align</strong>The byte range value in the request does
not align with the part size specified in the corresponding initiate request.
For example, if you specify a part size of 4194304 bytes (4 MB), then 0 to
4194303 bytes (4 MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to 8388607 (8 MB - 1) are valid part
ranges. However, if you set a range value of 2 MB to 6 MB, the range does not
align with the part size and the upload will fail.
</li>
</ul>
<p>This operation is idempotent. If you upload the same part multiple times, the
data included in the most recent request overwrites the previously uploaded
data.</p>
<p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However,
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don&#39;t have any permissions by
default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.
